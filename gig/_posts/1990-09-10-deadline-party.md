<a href="/wiki/deadline">Deadline</a> magazine party, sounds like the weekend of <a href="/wiki/ukcac">UKCAC</a> 1990. Live mustic from <a href="/wiki/cud">CUD</a>, <a href="/wiki/billy+childish">Billy Childish</a> and <a href="/wiki/sexton+ming">Sexton Ming</a> and more. Undoubtedly people dressed as <a href="/wiki/tank+girl">Tank Girl</a> too.

I did not go, sounds like this was a week or two after <a href="/wiki/ukcac">UKCAC</a> but I just kept the flyer.
