I personally think marine crescent is a lovely restoration there has been a lot of hard work thought and money put into the project M&B Builders should be proud of their work aswell as all the rest of the contractors involved in the project.
I would like to say a big WOW it looks really good and breathtaking.
Cant wait to see the finished project.
