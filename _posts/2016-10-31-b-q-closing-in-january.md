Hmm Folkestone B&Q is closing in January, something big will be able to take its place on the <a href="/wiki/park+farm">Park Farm</a> estate. <a href="/wiki/debenhams">Debenhams</a> was also rumoured to be closing then, so what could fill the place of Debenhams and B&Q? Where is the cross over between DIY ethic and soft furnishings...? <a href="/wiki/ikea">IKEA</a>! Come on IKEA, come to Folkestone, it's lovely!

Loads of bargains to be had at B&Q because of the closure I think, I will have to get up there.
