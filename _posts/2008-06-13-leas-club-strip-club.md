Story in one of the freesheets today about STRIPPERS at the Leas Club! That's going to send the <a href="/wiki/soon+to+be+no+more">soon to be no more</a> venue off with a bang isn't it? It's male strippers, and it's for charity, a ladies night fund raiser for breast cancer, which puts a nice unseedy topping on the whole affair.

Oh. It was yesterday.
