Thanks for the comprehensive review of Timothy's Wine Bar.  I found the review from a google search and must admit it put me off visiting the establishment.  Luckily my other half didnt listen to me and wanted to attend the school dinners evening ... Thank god he did.  What an evening.  Great hospitality, enjoyable food (although you probably cant go wrong with bangers and mash !) and good surrounding (better than the wooden shed effect of the old Sylvesters !).

We have been back again for another theme evening, this time 'Carry On'.  Another great night with good food (a bit more elaborate than the school dinner night) and very friendly service.  We did see the Spanish Manuel moustache and chuckled thinking it was a prop ..not.

I think you must have been unlucky with your visit and would certainly recommend it to any of my friends without hesitation.  Cheers ..
