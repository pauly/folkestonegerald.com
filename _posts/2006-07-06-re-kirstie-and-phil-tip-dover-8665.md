Hello Pauly

I'm another Manchester bod who wants to come and live in Folkestone. Whilst I get myself sorted, I'm thinking of buy-to-letting, but I'm unsure whether there is any demand for rental property in Folkestone yet. Lettings agents won't really give you an honest answer.

I'm hoping to buy and either move down or let until 2009 when properties should have increased in value.

Any gen or local knowledge much appreciated!!
