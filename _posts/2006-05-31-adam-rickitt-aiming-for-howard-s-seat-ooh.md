Some news from the weekend, just been reminded by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/05/31/nalist31.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/05/31/ixuknews.html">This piece in the Telegraph</a>, <a href="http://www.adamrickitt.com">Adam Rickett</a> formerly of [artist]Coronation Street and that has his eye on Michael Howard's seat.

<blockquote>A former Coronation Street actor on David Cameron's elite list of would-be MPs is aiming to inherit Michael Howard's safe Conservative seat, it emerged yesterday.</blockquote>

Zac Goldsmith has not ruled it out either - anything that puts Folkestone in the media is alright by me.
