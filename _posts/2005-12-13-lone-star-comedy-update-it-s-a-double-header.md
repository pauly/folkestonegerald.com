REGINALD D HUNTER (returning to the club after a revelatory headline performance last year, Reginald D. Hunter is the epitome of American cool, often described as the 'Samuel L. Jackson of stand-up'.  His material, his stage presence and all round general comedy-ness is second to none and he is the one of the finest headline acts in the UK - not to be missed)

GEORGE EGG (our second headliner of the evening!  Egg is an accomplished stand-up and visual comedian, armed with a briefcase of props, combining surreal stories and hilarious observations in an 'unrivalled comic experience')

CECILIA SMART (a regular contributor to Viz Magazine, and up and coming comic having performed at The Comedy Store, Amused Moose and many other major gigs in London)

NEIL MOONEY (performing in our open spot section, from Southampton, Neil did quite well in this years Chortle Student Comic Competition - I'm having trouble finding out much else about him!)

MC DANNY JAMES (for the last time!  it's going to be emotional!)
