It's got <a href="http://www.folkestoneharbour.com/">it's own website</a> you know... No sign of Roger DeHaan's masterplan there though, that's what I'm looking for!

Plans and models are quite possibly on show down at the harbour from this weekend. With an ice rink thrown in free!

UPDATE: Thanks "Anon", <a href="http://www.folkestoneharbour.com/pages/masterplan.html">the masterplan is now available online</a>, as a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdf">PDF</a>'s, so you might need need <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">the free reader from adobe.com</a>.
