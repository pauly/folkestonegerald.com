Again using a quote from someone else as a headline, how unimaginative... <a href="http://ticketsales.at/folkestonegerald/1082425.html">Get Me In say</a> Lee Mack is "highly regarded in industry circles as one of comedy's most exciting new prospects". Highly regarded yes, but "new prospect", really? He has been on TV for ages! He's in the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mighty-Boosh-BBC-Audiobooks/dp/0563527544">original radio series</a> of <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a> too, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mighty-Boosh-BBC-Audiobooks/dp/0563527544">check it out</a>...
