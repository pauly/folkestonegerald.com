Not sure from <a href="http://www.openaccess.gov.uk/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_12H/.cmd/acd/.ar/sa.map/.pm/-/.c/6_0_9H/.ce/7_0_15H/.p/5_0_LT/.d/7#7_0_15H">this map</a> whether <a href="/wiki/warren">The Warren</a> was always free to access, or whether it's just been opened up under the new <a href="http://www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk/">Countryside Access</a> legislation, anyone know?
