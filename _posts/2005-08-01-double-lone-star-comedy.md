Hello all,
 
In an attempt to get everything sorted before the Edinburgh Festival gets underway this weekend, here is all the information for the beginning of our Autumn season at the Lone Star Comedy Club.  We kick things off in style in September with not one, but two shows! 
 
We have our regular third Saturday club night on Saturday September 17th, featuring the following acts:
 
ROB DEERING (Rob is generally recognised as one of the best musical acts on the circuit, managing to be both comedically and musically talented as he also plays in a rock band.  You may recognise him from the current Strongbow advertising campaign which is in heavy rotation on television, or maybe from one of his Channel 5 presenting stints on either '99 Things To Do Before You're 30' or 'Movie Mistakes Uncovered Uncut'.  He is a great act, and has done a full-length solo Edinburgh show every year since 2002, with this year being no exception.  "sterling stand-up from one of the circuit's rising stars"- THE SUNDAY TIMES)
 
DIE CLATTERSCHENKENFIETERMAUS (Spoof German electronica duo, Die Clatter... have caused an enormous amount of hype on the national comedy circuit and led many respected people to proclaim them as the next big thing in British comedy.  We're delighted to have them down in a rare Southern appearance.  They are presenting their debut full-length Edinburgh show at this year's festival.  "the funniest show I've ever seen" - BBC ONLINE)
 
one more act TBC (as per usual, we'll be presenting an open spot, but it just hasn't been confirmed yet.  they'll be good though)
 
resident compere DANNY JAMES (finally making his return to our stage after an extended absence, Danny should be able to tell us some stories from his debut Edinburgh venture this summer, hosting his own radio show every evening in August which is available online from www.redfinger.fm every night from the 4th August from 9.30-10.30pm)
 
all this at THE LANTERNS, rendezvous street, FOLKESTONE
SATURDAY 17TH SEPTEMBER
doors open: 8pm, show starts: 8.30pm
8 / 6 concessions - phone 07810864228 for ticket information
 
=====
 
also in September, we host a special one-off comedy night for the Folkestone Literary Festival featuring the following acts:
 
ALEX HORNE (Alex is one of my personal favourite acts on the circuit, combining some simply inspired puns with some genuinely unique comic experiments on stage.  In 2003, he was nominated for the Perrier Best Newcomer award and in 2004 he won the Best Breakthrough Act at the Chortle Awards.  He is currently developing his own television pilot with Channel4 and will be performing his third full-length Edinburgh show this summer)
 
JOSIE LONG (Josie was so good when she performed a ten-minute open spot in January that we've invited her back for a full-length set.  Since then she has won the 2005 Chortle Award for Best New Act and been on tour with comedy luminary Stewart Lee.  She has also won the 1999 BBC New Comedy Award and was placed second in So You Think You're Funny)
 
guest compere ALISTAIR BARRIE (Al is one of the circuit's true veteran professionals, being generally regarded as one of the best current affairs comics around.  Although these days he's more likely to be found doing sets at clubs such as Jongleurs and The Comedy Store, he originally made his reputation as one of the best comperes on the circuit and it's our pleasure to welcome him back to this role at Lone Star for one night only!)
 
all this at THE LANTERNS, rendezvous street, FOLKESTONE
