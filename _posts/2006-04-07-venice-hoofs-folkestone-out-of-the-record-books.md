Venice has hoofed Folkestone out of the record books, now a Turner painting of the Grand Canal in Venice has become his most expensive work, at over twenty million quid. Previously it was a view of Folkestone, sold in 1984 for somewhere around nine million dollars.

<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2122304,00.html">The Times reports</a>:

<blockquote>Giudecca, La Donna della Salute and San Giorgio, a view of the Grand Canal in Venice from the island of Giudecca in the Venetian lagoon, had not been in seen in public for more than 30 years when it was put on display at Christie's in London last year.

Expected to fetch around 11 million, the painting easily surpassed the previous record sum paid for a British work: the $21,153,800 (12m) that purchased John Constables The Lock in 1990.</blockquote>
