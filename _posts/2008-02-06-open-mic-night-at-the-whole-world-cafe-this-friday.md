<blockquote>Hi Everyone!!
 
I am now running the Open Mic Night at the Whole World Cafe, the Old High St, Folkestone. This is a lovely venue which specialises in Ethical, Homemade Wholefood. The surroundings are colourful with a gallery of work from local artists adorning the walls.
 
It's this Friday 8th Feb and will be every 2 weeks. I will do a mail out for each one.
 
The Whole World Cafe is a child friendly venue.
 
They serve a range of coffes, teas and food and also has an alcohol licence. THERE IS A FREE DRINK FOR EVERY PERFORMER.
 
It will be an entertaining evening for all concerned whether performing or not. There is some great talent out there.
 
A full PA with feedback monitor will be set up. There are 2 mics available.
 
Bring your friends.</blockquote>
