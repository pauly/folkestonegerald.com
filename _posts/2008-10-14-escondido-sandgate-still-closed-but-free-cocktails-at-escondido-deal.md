Does not look like they're in a hurry to reopen Escondido <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a>, but they're trying to make a go of the <a href="/wiki/deal">Deal</a> branch, there's an offer of a free cocktail with presentation of the advert in <a href="http://www.myshepway.co.uk">My Shepway</a> free sheet.
