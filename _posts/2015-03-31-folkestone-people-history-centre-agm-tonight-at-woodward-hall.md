<blockquote>Quick reminder about our Folkestone People History Centre AGM tomorrow Tuesday 31st March 7.00 pm at the Woodward Hall.
Our speaker (changed from our initial announce) will be Dr Paul Bennett, Director of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust who will talk about Anglo-Saxon CSI Sittingbourne: a fascinating story of archaeology and science. 
 
In addition to Dr Bennett talk, you will hear about FPHC own CSI project 'Finding Eanswythe' which, after the success of 'A Town Unearthed', will explore the place of Folkestone in the Anglo-Saxon world.

This meeting and talk are entrance-free.  Post-AGM, FPHC will be resuming it's membership with a 5 annual fee which will give you access to free or discounted talks, events and previews.
