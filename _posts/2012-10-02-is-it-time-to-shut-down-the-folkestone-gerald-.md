For one I don't get much time to update it any more, but for another <a href="http://whatpub.com">CAMRA have launched their own</a>, and it's very good. Here's their page for <a href="http://whatpub.com/pubs/ASH/4100/chambers-folkestone">Chambers, Folkestone</a>, for example and here's <a href="http://whatpub.com/pubs/ASH/3986/fountain-hotel-hythe">my local that I rarely actually go in</a>...

I think it needs some more work, for instance they need to rationalise it with their <a href="/wiki/good+beer+guide">good beer guide</a> book and phone app, there is some crossover there, but if they can do that it will become a worthy rival to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://beerintheevening.com">beerintheevening.com</a>. And <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">The Gerald</a> of course...

I'm a <a href="/wiki/camra">CAMRA</a> member, find out more at <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk">camra.org.uk</a>.
