Hi I'm Alan Lockwood I worked as a booker with The Tempest Agency in the early 60's with Lorna (his girlfriend) We brought all the Motown acts into the UK which I am sure you saw in your part of the world
Roy was a hustler of the first order and it was when he tried to com me out of commission for booking everything into the Top Ten Club Hamburg that we parted company. All his vehicles were insured in my name and I just cancelled the policies..... great days.
