Why no mention of the free open air Sunday gigs at the Amphitheatre in the gig guide - well? Chanced upon <a href="/wiki/viramundo">VIRAMUNDO</a> playing an excellent latino set on a perfect summers afternoon! There are gigs there every Sunday till the 4th September. Dohh! 

Folkestone, sort yerself owt!.
