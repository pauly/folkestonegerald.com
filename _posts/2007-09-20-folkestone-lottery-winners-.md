Lordy, not me unfortunately. Lots of details <a href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Lotto-winner-denies-hoodie-claims-newsinkent5284.aspx">here in Kent News</a>, though it was also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7002911.stm">on the BBC</a>. Kelly Lucas and Ollie Kennedy are the names, if you want to tap them for a drink!
