i find it really hard to understand why certain people here cannot support local people who are trying to improve folkestone.i have visited the three mackeral on numerous occasions and have always found it to have a warm friendly atmosphere with pleasant,helpful staff.The landlady,Julie is an extremely hardworking young lady who puts in long hours and deserves the support of the good people of Folkestone.i have never witnessed any trouble or badly behaved customers in this bar and i feel that it is one of the few pubs in folkestone where you can feel at ease and genuinely welcome.I,for one,hope Julie stays on as landlady and feel that you should all do yourselves a favour and visit the three mackeral for a pint and a plate of the fantastic,locally caught fish and chips that they sell.
