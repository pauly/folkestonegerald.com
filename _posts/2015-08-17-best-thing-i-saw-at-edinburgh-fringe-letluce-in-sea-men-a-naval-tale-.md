This show was amazing. Not sure how I heard about this one or came to find it, might have been on a list somewhere. Or I might have been searching the listings for <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">Mighty Boosh</a> and <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/letluce-in-sea-men-a-naval-tale">found these compared</a> to them. Might just have been prowling the listings of <a href="/wiki/caves">The Caves</a> because I loved that venue last time. Anyway, find it we did.

I said to <a href="/wiki/clare">Clare</a> before the show that I had a good feeling about this one and good grief was that right. It's a very very funny show about a sea captain who catches a giant fish, they get talking and discover they're both heading to the same place. The mysterious <a href="/wiki/river+island">River Island</a> each for their own reasons. We meet other characters on the way, played by the same two. Little bit of audience participation too, but just so funny. I cried because I was laughing, and then found that when I stopped laughing I was still crying, because I loved it so much. The characters are great, the timing excellent, I loved everything about this.

Here's <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/NwL2hYaWRgEuM1ds8">a sneaky picture from inside the show</a>, taken from my seat, without the flash so as not to be annoying, glad it came out ok. Not sure it's normally ok to do this but I loved it so much I really wanted a souvenir of the show.

I did get a sticker too, but I think I cried on it, and now I bet it's gone through the washing machine.

I got a picture after the show too, like a twat. The fish had changed out of her costume but the captain was still partly in character:

No idea how to see <a href="/wiki/let+luce">Let Luce</a> next, I expect the next time will be on TV.
