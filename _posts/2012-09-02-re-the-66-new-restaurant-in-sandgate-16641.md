Myself and my partner ate at the sixty six a couple of weeks ago, and really enjoyed it! I had a roast dinner, and found the beef tender and lovely and pink, the service, as is the norm with new restaurants, could do with some polishing, but it was really tasting and good value for nice cuts of meat (and scrummy gravy!) It's a shane they don't appear to have flyered the area, as this would probably bring in more custom, but I noticed some poor reviews, which frankly I find rather unfair on such a new restaurant.  Give it time and I'm sure service etc will improve greatly!
