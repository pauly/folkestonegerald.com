Maybe it'll get cleaned up when the new centre opens? Or maybe you need stuff like this for a contrast, to make the other stuff look good. Most street markets are pretty scummy anyway, the Folkestone one probably isn't much worse than average, it's just that the average street market is a bad thing.

The crapness of this market has infected the harbour market too, that seemed like it would be quite nice when it first opened but there are a few stores down there too...
