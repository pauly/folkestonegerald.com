There's a voucher on <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.handbag.com">handbag.com</a> this week for a free meal in <a href="/wiki/pizza+express">Pizza Express</a>. We might well have gone there anyway, nice!

Oh also I sold my <a href="/wiki/stereophonics">Stereophonics</a> tickets at last (at cost price)! A night in! 

UPDATE: The voucher is no use at the weekends, so look out! There is a chance of a free bottle of wine there if you buy some <a href="http://www.filippoberrio.com">Filippo Berrio</a> olive oil though, we just got our voucher through the post. I think the free wine voucher is good for any time, even Saturdays, though you do have to spend over twenty quid.
