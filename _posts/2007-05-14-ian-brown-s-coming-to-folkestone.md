UPDATE: <a href="http://www.monsteresandcritics.com">monsteresandcritics.com</a> say 
<blockquote><a href="/wiki/ian+brown">Brown</a>'s tour will include dates at large academies as well as smaller venues, such as <a href="/wiki/folkestone+leas+cliff+hall">Folkestone Leas Cliff Hall</a> which will provide the perfect opportunity for fans to see <a href="/wiki/ian+brown">Brown</a> in a smaller, more intimate venue</blockquote>

Just popping that in as an update so you know I didn't copy and paste all the dates from them... <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/779371">Get tickets here</a>, when they go on sale. That doesn't earn the site any money still, it's just force of habit linking to them...
