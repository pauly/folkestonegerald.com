Woohoo Clare has just pointed out <a href="http://www.kesr.org.uk/whats-on-today/icalrepeat.detail/2012/06/16/19/46%7C42%7C45%7C44%7C41/camra-beer-festival.html">this</a>, and that it's <a href="/wiki/fathers+day">fathers day</a> weekend, and that she will drive me to it!

<blockquote>Celebrate the arrival of summer with a visit to the Kent & East Sussex Railway in Tenterden on Saturday 16 June 2012 for the annual CAMRA's Real Ale & Cider Festival.

This popular social event takes place between 11:00am and 10:30pm (or until the beer runs out!) and is organised with the <a href="/wiki/ashford">Ashford</a>, <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> and <a href="/wiki/romney+marsh">Romney Marsh</a> Branch of <a href="/wiki/camra">CAMRA</a>, the Campaign for Real Ale.

It's a great event and an online video of last year's festival can be seen on the railway's website under video lounge www.kesr.org.uk

On the day visitors can partake in a wide range of activities, from trying a diverse range of some of the finest Ale, Cider and Perry in the exclusive beer tent, or relaxing and listening to an eclectic mix of live music. This will all be complemented with a delicious selection of food from a BBQ or the stations licenced refreshment room.

The festival will get into full swing from midday when the first of five bands take to the stage, which is built across the railway track.

This year's band line-up is confirmed as;

12.30 pm - Stone Junction

3 pm - Colby Rivers Blues Band

4 pm - Bluezy Toonz

6 pm to 8 pm - Peoples Republic of Mercia

9 pm to 11 pm - The Swinging Sixties

Morris dancers will also be performing during the festival at around 5.30pm.</blockquote>
