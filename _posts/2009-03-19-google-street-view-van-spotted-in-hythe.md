<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Google maps</a> "street view" is all live for the UK as of today, London has lots of coverage and other major towns do too. Friends were just down <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> seafront, one said "wouldn't it be cool if we could get into Google street view" and SUDDENLY THE <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=google+street+view+van">GOOGLE STREET VIEW VAN</a> WENT PAST! How spooky is that?

Look out for it, surveying a street near you...
