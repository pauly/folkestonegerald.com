In <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald+the+herald">Folkestone Herald | the Herald</a> last week it said it's opening as some sort of medical / health centre. Where now might we ever see again bands of the calibre of <a href="/wiki/suede">Suede</a>, <a href="/wiki/manics">The Manics</a>, or <a href="/wiki/faith+no+more">Faith No More</a> playing in intimate surroundings?
