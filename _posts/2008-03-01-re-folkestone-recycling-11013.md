Well, it was 1994 when I was last living in the great village of Folkestone, but at the time I was trying my very best with the Folkestone & Hythe council to seriously consider a plant whereby unhappy males could take their drunken partners and, erm... sort of 'recycle' the women. Trouble was - I stipulated that the council must provide legal proof via the High Court of Civil Rights in London, that, in fact the females listed on a 'confirmation portfolio paper', would never be able to hit me with a telephone handset over my head - without due care and attention.

The case failed miserably, and several handsets were beginning to resemble ballistic missiles in court. Some members of the sandwich-handout team almost became bankrupt, when a whole tuna-mayonnaise buffet table, including the fresh bread (and the tweasers to pick the bones out the uncooked fish) was totally devastated by a blast by someone who had already eaten the 120 EGG & CABBAGE SARNIES ....ouch!
