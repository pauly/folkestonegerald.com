So get along! All sounds a little bit expensive to me, I guess I'm just out of touch with what it costs to go to a gig these days, but I would expect to only pay a fiver tops for acts I'd not heard of. Maybe you're cooler than me though and are well up on your your <a href="/wiki/3+daft+monkeys+cornish+folk+rock">3 Daft Monkeys Cornish folk rock</a> and so on. I hope this is a success, and this becomes part of the <a href="/wiki/barfly">Barfly</a> / <a href="/wiki/wedgewood+rooms">Wedgewood Rooms</a> / <a href="/wiki/joiners">Joiners</a> type circuit, they were all great local venues for me at the time, where you'd see up and coming and just about established bands at pocket money prices. Ee, and you could leave your back door open! What a moaning git. <a href="/wiki/dead+kids">Dead Kids</a> night sounds like a highlight to me, I might see you there. Or am I confusing them with <a href="/wiki/black+kids">Black Kids</a>?
I hope they shift their ticketing to Ticketweb or Ticketmaster soon, then I can really promote the events and take a little share of the revenue to prop this site up too...
