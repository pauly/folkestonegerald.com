<blockquote>THE prospect of fast train links into London is fuelling interest in the East Kent housing market.

A new review of the countrys property hotspots has identified what analysts call the hope value attached to the high-speed rail link, which will dramatically reduce commuting times to the capital.

It is still three years away but people are buying in Hythe, Folkestone and Canterbury in hope, said Cluttons in Canterbury.

The estate agent said the best properties went up around 10 per cent in 2006.

The review, published in the Sunday Telegraph, said the Medway Towns are hauling themselves out of neglect with billion pound regeneration schemes.</blockquote>
