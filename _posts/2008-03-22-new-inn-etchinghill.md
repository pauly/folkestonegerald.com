I regularly visit the new inn in etchinghill from my home in folkstone at least once a month with the family and the food is always top quality. The staff are always friendly and helpful and the chef makes the effort to meet  the customers. The owners are always there with a smile which makes this family run pub a most friendly place to eat and drink.
