<blockquote>Whites

2007, [vino]La Vigne de L'oubli[/vino], [vino]Domaine d'Escausses[/vino]: Made from a mixture of 15 to 50 year old vines, this is a barrel fermented blend of [vino]Sauvignon Blanc[/vino], [vino]Mauzac[/vino] and [vino]Muscadelle[/vino]. It has nice aromatic, almost curry spice aromas and a lovely waxy texture on the palate. A wonderful food wine as are most whites from Gaillac - 13.75

2008, [vino]Soave Classico[/vino], [vino]Inama[/vino]: One of the top three producers making Soave; This was the Soave that completely changed my perception of the wine. The vineyards are located on the hills of Foscarino notable for their basaltic lava soils that confer rich mineral flavours to the wine. The grapes are harvested by hand and selected according to ripeness. Skin contact with the grape must ensures greater colour and extract of flavour and allowing a malolactic fermentation gives a rounder, more buttery texture in the mouth.

Elegant nose of meadow flowers; camomile, elderflower and iris, this Soave is very attractive on the palate with a back taste of sweet almond and even a hint of lychee. The finish is powerfully mineral with recurrent stabs of crystalline fruit - 16.50
Reds

2006 [vino]Marcillac[/vino], [vino]Cuvee Vielles Vignes[/vino], [vino]Domaine du Cros[/vino]: Another unusual variety, this wine is made from 100% Mansois and one of the discoveries of the year for us. A great example of a 'wine of the earth' , the finish has a distinctive mineral flavour given the iron-oxide present in the soil. Again, a must-try wine!  - 12.95
2007 [vino]Pinotage[/vino], [vino]Inkawu[/vino], [vino]Stellenbosch[/vino]: I was never a fan of [vino]Pinotage[/vino] until I tried this. Lovely ripe flavours with banana, lavender and red berry characters prominent.  On the palate great balance and complexity, well supported by classic oak aromas.  What you smell is what you get and the mouth feel is rich and lively with different dimensions of flavour - 14.50
