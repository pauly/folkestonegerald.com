We were caught up in <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/27/500-trapped-for-6hrs-in-eurotunnel-115875-21627074/">one of these</a> once, we found the same thing, not much information going on. WE've had problems more than on ce on there, and we've not been on it a lot. It's a lovely idea, but has been a pain in practice.
