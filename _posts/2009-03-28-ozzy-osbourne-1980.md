I saw <a href="/wiki/ozzy+osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> in <a href="/wiki/1980">1980</a> at Canterbury Odeon - now the Marlowe.Had the privilege of being right at front and having Ozzy sweat on me whilst shaking his head about. Some of us went into the County hotel afterwards and all 4 of the band were in the bar and got all autographs. Lee kerslake and Bob Daisley took the time to talk to us which was great as we were a bunch of sweaty 16 year olds who I guess they could have done without tracking them down to their hotel. Great memory!
