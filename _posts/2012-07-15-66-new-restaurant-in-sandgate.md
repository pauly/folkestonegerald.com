Been through <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a> today and I see there's a new restaurant opening up <a href="/wiki/66+steakhouse">The 66 Steakhouse</a>, where <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> originally was (and what was <a href="/wiki/la+bougie">La Bougie</a> before that). No idea what it will be like, except I guess it sounds meaty. Don't think it is open yet.
