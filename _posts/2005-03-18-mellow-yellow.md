Oh it's not just bands from the 80s that come to Folkestone, now we're going back to the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/1966/">1960's</a> <a href="http://www2.ticketmaster.co.uk/cgi/asp_events/byid.asp?event_id=17003A7199473C46&category=CONCERTS&affiliate=POPE">Donovan comes to Folkestone</a> on the 12th of May. 

He's Shaun Ryder's father in law you know.
