To be honest I was rather shocked to see the negatives posted here about Tavernetta. I've been coming here for years, and rather like it.  OK it's not nouvelle cuisine, not trendy, menu is a bit 1960's perhaps.  But actually the cooking is mostly very good. Pasta dishes exceptional.  Whitebait better than at the Trafalgar Tavern Greenwich (which is famous for it).  Only one criticism, the prawn cocktail is usually pretty taseless (industrial polystyrene frozen prawns).  The rest is fine.

I think there must be a local vendetta in Folkestone to prompt these negative reports. Shame on you. If you want to lure people away from this place, try offering a better service youselves. Don't diss the Tavernetta.
