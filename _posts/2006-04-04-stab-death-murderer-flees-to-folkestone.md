<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/humber/4876006.stm">BBC has this nasty story</a>, about someone stabbing their boss because they couldn't have they day off... it was in Hull, but then he fleed to Folkestone.

<blockquote>Saman Sali Karim, 26, of Melville Street in the city admitted killing Mark Conway, 28, at Land Food Products in Copenhagen Road (in Hull) on 12 August.

Hull Crown Court heard Karim had been "in a strop" as he had not been allowed to have the day off.

After the attack, he escaped to a flat in Folkestone, Kent, but was later arrested by armed police. </blockquote>
