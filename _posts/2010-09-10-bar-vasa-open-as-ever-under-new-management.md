HI GUYS,

I THOUGHT I WOULD POST A MESSAGE JUST TO CLEAR UP ANY CONFUSION REGARDING THE AMAZING VENUE THAT IS BAR VASA IN SANDGATE. BAR VASA IS MORE "OPEN" THAN EVER, SO DON'T BELEIVE ANY OF THE RUMOURS FLOATING AROUND SAYING THAT IT IS CLOSING OR BEING CONVERTED TO FLATS. IT IS STILL SERVING GREAT FOOD & DRINK, PROVIDING GREAT ENTERTAINMENT & MUSIC AND AS FROM SEPTEMBER 18TH WILL BE OPENING ITS UPSTAIRS BAR, SERVING COCKTAILS.

&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;&#10031;

BAR VASA - Sandgate has always been legendary for its great food, beautiful terrace and luxury upstairs restaurant...........now we are poised to become legendary for our events.

Our new management team have joined forces with DJ & Promoter "MJ Simes" to bring you the very best aural entertainment available.

Come join us every Friday & Saturday night, where you will experience an eclectic mix of music which is guaranteed to get you up on the dancefloor before you know it.
