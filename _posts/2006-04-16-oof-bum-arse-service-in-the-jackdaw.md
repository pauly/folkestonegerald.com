Just been to The Jackdaw for lunch, and though the food was great again (one Indonesian vegetable satay, one roast beef and one roast turkey, not all me you understand) we had a hiccup with our starter. The main courses came before the starter, not ideal, and we were told "well, your main's here now, do you still want it then?", no apology or anything, like it was our fault.

Puds were good, and so was the wine, and again the bus was outside bang on time to take us back to Folkestone, all told a good meal for us. Less so for the waitress, who missed out on a tip.
