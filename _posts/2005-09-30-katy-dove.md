Dove's mesmerising kaledoscopic animations investigate the complex relationship between colour and sounds. Much of her work takes the form of a visual and audio representation of an idea, emotion or perception using animation to reduce experience to its basic state. Brightly coloured amorphous shapes dance to hypnotic music - dividing, multiplying and dissolving. Influences include the experimental filmmaker <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Len%20Lye">Len Lye</a> as well as modern masters such as wassily Kandinsky with his intuitive use of colour and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Pail%20Klee">Pail Klee</a> who believed that a perfect geometry could be found in the natural world.
