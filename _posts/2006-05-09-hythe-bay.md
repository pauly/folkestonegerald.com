Normally excellent, and we had another wonderful meal. Redecoration has done it no harm as well.

BUT while the food is still delicious, the portion sizes have reduced a little under new ownership.

I'll be going again, hoping this was just a one-off. Here's hoping for a few more oysters next time!
