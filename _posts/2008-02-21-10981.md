Well i live opposite saw the whole damn thing pretty sick stuff, But then the gang got really out of hand hells-angels i think crazy mothers. There was guns, knifes, baseball bats, one guy even had a molotov cocktail which he failed to light but great effort. At this stage i ran for my cam corder Returned with all my haste to find the police had turned up to break up the party. So i began to record when a police officer saw me at the window and began walking towards my front door OOps! I opend the front door and he requested i hand over my cam for evidence . Which upon this request I refused and hence got tazerd , Unfortunatly for the police officer he managed to destroy all recordings on the cam . What a Cock .... Thanks Yours Faithfully BOB
