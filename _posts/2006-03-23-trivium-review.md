The Trivium gig sounds like it was great, just seen this post on <a href="http://www.onfolkestone.co.uk">onfolkestone.co.uk</a>:
<blockquote>Liked a few Bloodsimple songs, God Forbid were immense but Trivium damn well ruled, they had power and alot of control.

Best moments -

The Shredathon they had
Playing Master of Puppets (even tho the singer was bull crap cos he was from the crowd)
Seek & Destroy
The little piss about they had at the end, playing (among other things) Sweet Home Alabama, Lose Yourself, The Trooper, a coupla Queen songs...

The most amazing part of that gig however was their dedication to Dimebag Darrell (god rest his metal infused soul) followed by a coupla Pantera bits...</blockquote>
