Don't be rubbing it in about your enormous mansion, we have traded in rented flats in the London for another flat in Folkestone, albeit quite a nice one... good to know there's more people out there in the same boat!

I Don't do sports, but there does seem to be quite a covers band scene in the area, see <a href="http://www.mrgig.com">mrgig.com</a> for more, and let me know if you form a band! 

Next quiz we're going to is on xmas day at <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a>... it does seem like there are only stumbling pensioners and teenage car thieves in town at times, but my theory is there's a big population of cultured nobs like us, waiting by the front door ready to burst onto the streets and reclaim Folkestone as a Nice Place...

This website's my small attempt to stir up interest in things that I like, though as you can see it's a bit quiet so far...
