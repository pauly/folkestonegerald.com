The Fountain Pub is great. The atmosphere is enjoyable, and the food is fantastic! The location is perfect for if your coming or going to the beach, or walking along the Hythe canal. It is also great for kids, with a play area in the large beer garden. I would definitely recommend this pub to friends and family.
