<a href="http://rhysdgriffiths.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/folkestones-creative-quarter-why-so-negative/">Great blog post here</a> by @rhysdgriffiths gives all the facts about who's opening and who's not opening where in the <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter">creative quarter</a>. I was suspicious of the <a href="/wiki/max+s+house">Max's House</a> people, their web stuff seemed to be all over the place. Seems they were planning to open in the old <a href="/wiki/earl+grey">Earl Grey</a> but are not right now, maybe in the future though. Some good details on other things that should, hopefully, one day, happen in Folkestone too
