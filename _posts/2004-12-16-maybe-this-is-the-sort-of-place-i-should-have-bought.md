Having a scan of <a href="http://www.homes-on-line.com">homes-on-line.com</a> for <a href="/wiki/folkestone+property">Folkestone property</a>, and found only one property - <a href="http://www.homes-on-line.com/kent/haxtons.017/full/f017_1462.htm">this</a>. I'm sure this is already sold, can't believe it's only 250k, that's the sort of place I should probably have gone for, some income potential, and a lot closer to <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a>...
