Can you find it <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=wear+bay+road&spn=0.006581,0.014820&t=h&hl=en">on this satellite picture</a>? Double click to centre it, then right click on "link to this page", copy the link / shortcut and paste it back here...

I found a bit more about the history of my place in <a href="/wiki/earls+avenue">Earls Avenue</a> this weekend, more people are saying it was a school that was converted into flats in the 1950's... the top floor of the building seems to have been added / expanded into in the 1940's though. There's a whole lot of buildings of historic interest around our way! Do you know anything about <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1920/The+Clifton+Hotel">The Clifton Hotel</a>? I don't think it got a mention in <a href="/wiki/more+tales+from+the+tap+room">More Tales From The Tap Room</a>.
