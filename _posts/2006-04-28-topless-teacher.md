Could you make it up? The <a href="http://www.harveygs.kent.sch.uk/">Harvey Grammar School</a> teacher who stepped in to replace the teacher from who left after it was alledged that he'd looked adult material on a school computer has also been asked to leave; this one for appearing topless in a magazine. It was <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk">Cosmo</a>, rather than "Red Hot Teachers From Behind" or something, but still they didn't like it.

Of course, <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006190551,00.html"> The Sun has it</a>.
