Folkestone's own <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebufftings">Bufftings</a> are trekking up to London, doing a gig only a few yards from my desk! If you fancy coming to London on a Saturday, and seeing them play with <a href="http://www.rieser.co.uk/">Rieser</a> (from Edinburgh) and <a href="http://www.theyamyams.co.uk/">The Yam Yams</a> at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2185/Betsey%20Trotwood">The Betsey Trotwood</a>, get in touch with Todd via <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebufftings">The Bufftings myspace</a> and book yourselves onto their coach.

Here's what The Betsey Trotwood themselves have to say about the band... "they draw from a wide range of musical influences including <a href="/wiki/bjork">Bjork</a>, <a href="/wiki/cure">The Cure</a>, intense electronica, guitar noise and post-rock ambience. Live, the bufftings seamlessly blend sequenced beats and bleeps with layered guitar melodies and searing vocals. After moaning for a couple of years about no bands producing the kind of noise they wanted to listen to, Todd and Si decided to stop the talking and form a band themselves. After a couple of brief (and aborted) line-ups, Tim soon joined to complete the band. <a href="/wiki/bufftings">The Bufftings</a> have a large catalogue of original material - from epic, drawn-out soundscapes to intense bursts of noise and urgent beats drenched with feedback. They have a self-financed 3 track ep which is available to buy for a couple of quid at their live shows"

Got more of their gigs added to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">folkestonegerald.com</a> now, including their regular clubnights at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/4/Chambers">Chambers</a>.
