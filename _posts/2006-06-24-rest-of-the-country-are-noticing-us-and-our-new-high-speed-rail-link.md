<blockquote>From 2009, the trains will run between <a href="/wiki/london">London</a>'s King's Cross station and <a href="/wiki/ashford">Ashford</a> in 36 minutes - less than half the time it takes at present.

<a href="/wiki/london">London</a> to <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> journeys, which currently take 102 minutes, will come down to 60 minutes, while <a href="/wiki/london">London</a> to <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>, currently a journey that can take up to 98 minutes, will come down to 62.5 minutes.</blockquote>

Front page of the Evening Standard yesterday, with pictures of the new bullet trains, though they do say ticket prices are likely to rise by SEVENTY percent, yoinks. Canterbury is sounding more attractive than Folkestone right now, though I do like being right on the sea, and it's still affordable here.
