<blockquote><a href="/wiki/adam+rickitt">Adam Rickitt</a>, one of the most controversial members of David Cameron's priority list of prospective MPs, has failed in his first attempt to be accepted as a Conservative candidate.

Mr Rickitt, 28, a former member of the cast of the television soap opera Coronation Street, did not make <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/05/31/nalist31.xml" title="See the full shortlist here">a shortlist of 20 hopefuls for Folkestone and Hythe</a>, the seat being vacated by Michael Howard, the former Tory leader, at the next election.</blockquote>
