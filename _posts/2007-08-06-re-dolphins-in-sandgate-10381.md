Ive seen the dolphin/s on several occasions/visits to sandgate,but yesterday was amazing!i was swimming out to one of the yellow bouys,there were two canoes around,when suddenly a huge dolphin(dave?)came toward me,blew out air and swam all around me,he touched me,once!,then swam away after awhile.I found it quite scary,but SO exhilerating!im sure i'll be boring friends and family for a while by telling the story over and over!!!But it certainly made my day!(is Dave the right name for such a beautiful & glorius beast tho?? just a thought)
