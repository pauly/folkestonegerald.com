<a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/news/2009/november/4/leas_cliff_hall_sold_as_part_o.aspx">It says here</a>... Hmm seems to have been the fairly recent takeover by Live Nation that brought bands of the "standard" of <a href="/wiki/stereophonics">Stereophonics</a>, <a href="/wiki/kings+of+leon">Kings of Leon</a>, <a href="/wiki/pete+doherty">Pete Doherty</a>, <a href="/wiki/david+gray">David Gray</a> and the <a href="/wiki/kooks">Kooks</a>, I wonder if we'll see more musical theatre or something now?

I wonder if the <a href="/wiki/editors">Editors</a> show was booked before or after this takeover/
