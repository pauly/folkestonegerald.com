Press release:
<blockquote>One of KENT's finest singer-songwriters, RAPHAEL MEAD, celebrates
Valentine's Day with a special, intimate concert, ahead of a short
visit to NASHVILLE and then the release of his second album, RULED BY
THE HEART, in March.

Raphael started his musical journey in some of the best recording
studios in London, working with many artists including MORRISSEY and
top producer PETER COLLINS, (RUSH, ALICE COOPER and BON JOVI).
Raphael's distinct and individual style has won him much acclaim and
many fans, in the UK and overseas.  Concerts in ITALY and ESTONIA,
plus opening slots for artists in the UK, including COLIN BLUNSTONE
and KIKI DEE, have served to increase his ever-growing fan base.
RULED BY THE HEART features eleven tracks, all written by Raphael, and
is perhaps his most accessible work to date and is sure to bring
further attention to him.

For the Valentine Day's concert Raphael will be joined on stage as
usual by renowned multi-instrumentalist, arranger and producer
GEOFFREY RICHARDSON, and top musician ANDY BRIGGS, and the show
promises to be a perfect way to spend a romantic evening, and also to
get a sneak preview of the new album.

The concert is at KINGSTON BARN, THE STREET, KINGSTON, CT4 6JQ.  The
doors open at 7:30 p.m., with the show starting at 8:00 p.m.  Tickets
are 8.00, 6.00 concessions, available on the door or by calling
01303 840324 or 07875 379723
