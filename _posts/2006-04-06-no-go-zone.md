Heard this morning that M&S is closing <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=marks+and+spencer+in+folkestone&ll=51.079775,1.180269&spn=0.003195,0.004399&t=h">their store in Sandgate Road</a>... it's only them and Ottakers that make that bit of high street worth visiting, what a shame. Hopefully this is the dark before the dawn of the new shopping centre.

Check out <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=marks+and+spencer+in+folkestone&ll=51.079775,1.180269&spn=0.003195,0.004399&t=h">a satellite view of Folkestone town centre</a>, as it is now, before it all changes...

Hmm, there was a rumour a while back of M&S selling more online, through Amazon, which means ultimately through this site too... so if you're looking to buy some new pants, hold on and I'll try and put up some links!

More news on where they're moving to (and if they really are, maybe I misheard) as it comes in...
