So does <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4840310.stm">this piece from the BBC</a> mean <a href="/wiki/roger+dehaan">Roger DeHaan</a>'s plans are finally out? I missed the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> yesterday...

UPDATE: Ooh yeah it does, and it's looking good, let's get a move on... Looking forward to nipping down to the harbour next month to see these models / plans in person, and not just the details in the paper...
