when you go in the cafe you do not know what to do i.e self serve or be sit and be served.. it turns out it depends on the mood of the owner. The eldery Irish lady seemed bored to be there but i did order my food which was hard work as the black board was not updated the food came to me 40 minutes later and was average but ok.. my coffee was cold and weak too.. I will not be going back..
