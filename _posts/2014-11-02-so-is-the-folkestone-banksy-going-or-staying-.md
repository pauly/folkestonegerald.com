It's been cut down, but where is it going next? It's been taken for "safe keeping" by <a href="/wiki/robin+barton">Robin Barton</a> an art dealer who specialises in asset stripping <a href="/wiki/banksy">Banksy</a> artworks like this. Who knows, maybe he even is Banksy, that would be fair and make sense. I guess he's just a tailcoat grabber following the gold rush though. The art work is owned by <a href="/wiki/dreamland+amusements">Dreamland Amusements</a> (the <a href="/wiki/godden">Godden</a> family) so it's up to them what happens next, it could be sold and go anywhere. Maybe someone local will buy it and it could stay locally? Would be outrageous for anyone in Folkestone to have to stump up a quarter of a million or more though to keep something in the area that was on the streets of Folkestone for all to enjoy for free though, it is an odd one.

The Godden family say (I saw it on kentonline or folkestoneherald) that the profits will go to the <a href="/wiki/jimmy+godden">Jimmy Godden</a> cancer charity. Would be nice if they just contributed something to the town though.
