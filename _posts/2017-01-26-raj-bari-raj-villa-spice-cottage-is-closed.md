The curry house at the bottom of our road is gone. We didn't use it very often, they were pretty unreliable with takeaway, though was good when I ate in once. A friend was there at Christmas, so it was open then. I noticed the signage was changing again, thought it was changing names back. It's been <a href="/wiki/raj+bari">Raj Bari</a> and <a href="/wiki/raj+villa">Raj Villa</a> and then <a href="/wiki/spice+cottage">Spice Cottage</a> (plus of course <a href="/wiki/little+chef">Little Chef</a> a long time ago). But no, just looks closed now.

No planning notices up yet, but it would be a prime spot to throw a few nice flats up. Would actually impinge on our view if they were high enough, I don't fancy that much! Should be another restaurant, a nice one that made use of the sea view they have. 

Will report back if I spot anything.
