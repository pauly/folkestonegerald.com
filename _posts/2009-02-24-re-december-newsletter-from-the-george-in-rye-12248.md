Interesting to see this newsletter, because I stayed at the George over Christmas and was very dissatisfied.  Lots of broken promises, disappointing food and, sadly, no sense of occasion.  I wrote to Alex and Katie after the event (they weren't present at Christmas) but didn't even get the courtesy of an acknowledgment - they just passed my letter on to the manager.  He accepted many of my criticisms but offered nothing other than assurances that they will consider them for future events.  They seem to be strong on marketing but weak on performance.
