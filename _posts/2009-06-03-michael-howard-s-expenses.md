So should we be angry about <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5418996/MPs-expenses-Michael-Howards-17000-claims-for-gardening.html">this sort of behaviour</a>, or pleased that Mr Howard is spending money in the area (in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>, but still)? Have we been cheated more than we've benefitted? I can't work it out? 

Remember to vote tomorrow people!
