I am a local kent promoter and have been contacted by red list about what I do. I have been assured that the men responsible for the zoo festival are not involved in anyway. Now from what I gather, there is a whole team of people working down there who have done other festivals in the UK that have been a success so I can only see this as being a positive thing.<br />
<br />
I think we as a town and as a county should support this and every event that happens in Kent. We really missout on a lot of amazing music, comedy and other entertainment and although those idiots that did that event in 2008 that is no way that we should give up on supporting anyone else that wants to provide events down here.

On another note, I guarantee you that before any event like this goes ahead, red list have to get a license. can you see shepway council giving that to the zoo8 boys. i strongly doubt it.
