all welcome to see a continuation of some of the poster modern work seen earlier in the year

at <a href="/wiki/georges+house+gallery">georges house gallery</a>, 8 the old high street:

preview from 7.30 - 9 pm

come along and see these young and extremely talented contemporary illustrators make their debut in their home town. layla is currently studying at falmouth and kieron at brighton.
at the leas lift, curated by club shepway: 

on saturday 16th and sunday 17th in direct response to the theme of the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+triennial">folkestone triennial</a> - <a href="/wiki/travels+through+time+and+space">travels through time and space</a>, collaborative artists kieren reed and abigail hunt are turning
the leas lift into a 40 second time machine.

the idea of an alternative reality makes reference to a whole genre of films and literature since the nineteenth century, such as <a href="/wiki/back+to+the+future">back to the future</a>, <a href="/wiki/slaughter+house+5">slaughter house 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/h+g+wells">H.G. Wells</a> "<a href="/wiki/time+machine">the time machine</a>" and <a href="/wiki/xavier+de+maistre">Xavier de Maistre</a>s "<a href="/wiki/a+journey+around+my+room">a journey around my room</a>".

working with the social excitement of the theme park ride and the <a href="/wiki/dr+who">Dr Who</a> generation, the artwork playfully teases the audience into suggesting that it is their very being on the lift which is taking them into the future, and not simply the fact that we are just seeing the passing of 40 seconds of time. at the DIY fringe:

<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=victoria+tami+duzek-woodward">victoria tami duzek-woodward</a> has been back in town leaving behind her teddy bears; tangible references to her developing work on unspoken conversation between lost and found. for more information on the artists work please visit here
