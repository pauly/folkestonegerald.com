features some pretty nifty design and a museum, can't believe I've not checked it out yet! Hmm, they also have a <a href="http://www.jahlis.net/cgi-jahlis/alcalendar/calendar.pl">calendar</a> very similar to one on this site, there's no connection whatsoever though and I'd guess theirs has been in place longer. It's hosted at Maidstone company <a href="http://www.jahlis.net/">Jahlis</a> for some reason.

Hmm, they have an ampersand in their URL, that's not proper is it?
