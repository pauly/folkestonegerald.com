On the Tasting Table this weekend....

Sweet

[vino]2005[/vino] [vino]Jurancon[/vino], [vino]La Magendia de Lapeyre[/vino]: A real find recently - [vino]La Magendia[/vino] is the Occitan expression for 'the best'. This wine is made from 100% [vino]Petit Manseng[/vino] and harvested as late as December in some years, exhibiting a sublime expression of sweet fruity: mangoes, coconut, grapefruit and banana bound by cristal-pure acidity. Magical an an aperitif - 13.50

White

[vino]2008[/vino] [vino]Sannio Falanghina[/vino], Vesevo, Campania Italy: Some of the finest white wines in the world are now coming out of this part of Italy. It is a wine region not only blessed with perfect hillside vineyard sites and complex volcanic soils but also with indigenous white grapes that can produce wines of real quality. This is one such variety, the others being [vino]Greco di Tufo[/vino] and [vino]Fiano di Avellino[/vino]. This wine has a lovely fresh scented character to the nose and on the palate, positively dances with zesty minerality - 10.50

[vino]2007[/vino] [vino]Chardonnay[/vino], [vino]Macon-Peronne[/vino], [vino]Jaffelin[/vino]: Typical of what is happening in [vino]Burgundy[/vino] these days (and the wines are the better for it), Jaffelin is an established Burgundian name rejuvenated by a younger generation of winemakers. The [vino]Macon Peronne[/vino] (formerly [vino]Macon Fuisse[/vino]) is fermented in old oak barrels so as not to overpower the lively lemony fruit but at the same time give it structure and soft hints of vanilla  the hallmarks of good white Burgundy - 11.50

Red

[vino]2008[/vino] [vino]Pinot Noir[/vino], [vino]Omrah[/vino], Western Australia: Light brick-red in colour, with aromas of ripe strawberries and spice that carries through to the palate, which has subtle soft tannins, medium weight and good length - 10.50

[vino]2001[/vino] [vino]Barolo[/vino], [vino]Roggeri[/vino]: A really special Barolo from a top class vintage. They say only the best Barolos deliver the characteristic aromoas of tar and roses and this is such a wine. Brick red colour with beguiling aromas of compote red fruits, wild mushrooms and intensely perfumed red roses. It's still a young wine even after nine years but with some air in a decanter, this will evolve beautifully over the course of an evening - 44.50 

Happy Valentines Day
