Went to Euphoria on Saturday afternoong, which is where The Nostalgia Bar was, which is where The Front was before that. Now the '50s theme has been dropped, and it's just a nice bar again, nice to sit outside anyway, the high energy happy hardcore young people's dance music they were playing in the bar was a bit offputting.

We returned to the scene of the crime that evening, but didn't go inside, there seemed to be more people working security on the door than drinking inside, don't know what sort of trouble they were expecting.
