Folkestone gets noticed by the national news again <a href="http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=14791009&method=full&siteid=106694&headline=the-danger-of-passive-smoking--name_page.html">in this story about passive smoking</a>... A non smoking journalist crawls some pubs and measures the levels of carbon monoxide in their bloodstream... "For some reason The Harvey's Wine Bar in Folkestone, Kent, fared better than the rest"...

Hmm, new review of <a href="/wiki/shanel+s+brasserie">Shanel's Brasserie</a> up soon on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/restaurants/">Folkestone RestauRANTS</a>, they were crap at the weekend... was it YOUR hen night dominating the one waitress so no-one else could get food?
