All this if for a new book on the history of Westbrook House School from 1957 - 2005. It will of necessity include its amalgamations with Riverdale School/ Dover College Junior School and St Mary's Convent. The website is a talking shop where interested parties can find their contemporaries and snippets of info gleaned from sites such as yours (which is great!).
