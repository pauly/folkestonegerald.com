And it was good again... still popular, as we could only be squeezed in for a table at nearly 10pm, booking in advance... guess this shows that there's not a lot of choice in the area and / or people get frightfully excited about any new restaurant. Go on, open one yourself! We'll come to it!

We had exactly the same meal as last time, steak for Clare and polenta for me, the same wine and the same chips and dips on the side... The only thing that had changed was the polenta, it was a slightly smaller portion, and served on a bed of slightly different mushrooms. To be fair, last time I left some, there was too much, so if other punters had also been leaving a bit on the plate, then resizing the portion is a smart thing to do.

Bit of a rowdy crowd in there this time, but still mostly a younger and cooler set.

Hungry now, I want to go back...
