<blockquote>Here Now

 

In support of the Folkestone Book Festival I have specially commissioned pieces by several artists, inspired by the works of <a href="/wiki/h+g+wells">H. G. Wells</a>. The exhibition is comprised of works in Pottery, Glass and Paint; all drawing their influence from not only Wells' more famous works such as "The War of the Worlds" and "The Time Machine", but also "The Sea Lady... a Tissue of Moonshine" which Wells wrote whilst living in Folkestone. The exhibition ends 15th November.  All works are for sale.
