Some oaf has hit the <a href="/wiki/sandgate+dolphin">Sandgate Dolphin</a> (most likely ) with a boat propellor, chopping off a big chunk of her tail <a href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Fears-as-Dave-the-dolphin-sustains-major-injury-newsinkent5902.aspx" title="Details and pictures">according to Kent News</a>. Pictures there, very sad.
