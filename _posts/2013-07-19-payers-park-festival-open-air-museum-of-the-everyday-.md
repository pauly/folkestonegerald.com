<blockquote>The forgotten piece of land that fills the void between <a href="/wiki/quarterhouse">Quarterhouse</a>, <a href="/wiki/old+high+street">The Old High Street</a> and <a href="/wiki/grace+hill">Grace Hill</a> (otherwise known as <a href="/wiki/payers+park">Payers Park</a>) is at the moment simply known as a car park, a dumping ground and a short cut you would avoid at night. But plans are in motion to develop this neglected patch into an area that is for the community.

A series of events are due to take place in <a href="/wiki/payers+park">Payers Park</a> between Saturday 20 July and Sunday 28 July to celebrate the start of this project. Honouring the past, present and future of the park there will be a whole host of activities including an archaeological dig, making bread in a clay oven, live music, outdoor animation screenings and more. The hope is that these events will bring the residents of the Creative Quarter and wider community together and get excited about the rejuvenation of this unkempt park.</blockquote>

Well I did not know it had a name. This covers our birthday weekend, we're planning on heading that way on the Sunday anyway, nice.
