You would think The <a href="/wiki/folkestone+gerald">Folkestone Gerald</a> would know what's the best pub with a TV in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a>, but, um, I'm a bit out of touch. So where? So far I have <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/the-globe/pub-bar-booze-venue-1918/index.html">The Globe</a> or <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/the-swan-hotel/pub-bar-booze-venue-3782/index.htmlThe">Swan Hotel</a>. I have discounted <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/the-fountain/pub-food-real-ale-venue-2032/index.html">The Fountain</a>, because though it may be nice and close to home I want the option to do a bit of a crawl after.
