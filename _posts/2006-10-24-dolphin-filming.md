<a href="/wiki/dolphin+dave+the+dolphin">dolphin | Dave the Dolphin</a> has been in touch again, firstly with a full filming schedule from the BBC (their <a href="/wiki/inside+out">Inside Out</a> TV programme will be filming a Folkestone Dolphin special), and local people really ought to be involved... The plan is:
<blockquote>Meet near the harbour on Thursday around nine. meet at the ship Sandgate around midday.
Friday. Meet at Daves beach at nine. Meet at the Clarendon AT Midday.</blockquote>
They surely didn't mean to send the whole filming schedule to everyone, but it's interesting to see that they can afford to stay at the Sandgate Hotel on our license payers money... It's a bit of a walk from the Sandgate Hotel to the harbour isn't it?
