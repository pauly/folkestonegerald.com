Has there been a fire? And did Gate 28 reopen? We were not in that part of town all weekend.

Here is video of a fire in Escondido:

That's Escondido, California though, not our favourite local restaurant. Yes, still my favourite, went to <a href="/wiki/sandbanks">Sandbanks</a> this weekend but I'd definitely still choose <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a>, even if just for the better vege choice.
