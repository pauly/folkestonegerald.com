I broke into a cold sweat when I saw the TV prog was about my newly adopted hometown, but as it turned out, Folkestone didn't fare too badly compared to Dover, while Southend was portrayed as place to definately avoid after dark! One daylight scene was of an unfamiliar view of the harbour, (propably shot from upstairs at the Bursten) - it looked like a Cornish fishing village and I thought 'thats a nice place - wouldn't mind living there' - 'oh yer... I do'
