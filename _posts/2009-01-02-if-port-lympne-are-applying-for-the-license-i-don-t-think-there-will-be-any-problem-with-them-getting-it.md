The issue might be getting bands to play, after what happened last year. If none of the same people are involved then I expect big bands will start to sign up, but obviously punters are going to hold off spending the money on tickets until either some big names are confirmed. Maybe people will take a chance and pay a "local festival" type price, but this year people might balk at an expensive ticket price anyway. This goes for all festivals that don't have a good solid reputation behind them.
