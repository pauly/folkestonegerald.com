<blockquote>Sellindge Music Festival made another exciting announcement this week with the news that all ticket buyers in April will be automatically entered into a special prize draw to win a VIP weekend on the 5th, 6th & 7th June.

The festival, whose line-up will see the legendary <a href="/wiki/supergrass">Supergrass</a> top a bill including <a href="/wiki/young+knives">Young Knives</a>, <a href="/wiki/holloways">The Holloways</a>, <a href="/wiki/red+light+company">Red Light Company</a> and a fantastic array of new music in the shape of Marina & The Diamonds, Thomas Tantrum, The Answering Machine, 4 or 5 Magicians, Video Nasties and several others,
takes place in the countryside between Ashford and Folkestone on the first weekend of June.

The chance to win the VIP package is open to everyone who buys their ticket before midnight on Thursday 30th April and includes a limo ride for four to the festival site, a priority camping spot and equipment including tent, sleeping bags, chairs and food, helicopter tours and an overnight stay at the 4-Star Hythe Imperial Hotel at the end of the festival, where theyll be treated to a full breakfast and a visit to the spa the following morning. Once theyve recovered from the long weekend, the limo will take them back home.

Aside from the music, the festival also promises stand-up comedy, food,
drink, trade stalls, a funfair and helicopter tours.

Tickets are available to buy online and from selected outlets across the
South East. For full information visit <a href="http://sellindgemusicfestival.co.uk">sellindgemusicfestival.co.uk</a></blockquote>
