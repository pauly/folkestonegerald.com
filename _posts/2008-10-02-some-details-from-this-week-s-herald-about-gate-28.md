According to the Folkestone Herald:

It's under new ownership because <a href="/wiki/roger+dehaan">Roger DeHaan</a> sold the freehold, hmm why would he do that? I wonder if it's because <a href="/wiki/jimmy+godden">Jimmy Godden</a> has been buying up properties on the same street.
The same owner owns the Gate Inn in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> and other pubs, he's pictured in the paper.
Along with the freehold of Gate 28 he's bought the shop next door, which will be expanded into as a restaurant. Wouldn't it have made sense to do that before opening? Expanding in to it now will involve moving the bar or having to shift that new plasma telly at least.
