Ha! The guy from Trent would say that wouldn't he?

Actually, if the council accept the D'Haan/Foster designs as the masterplan for the area, then Godden/Trent will be forced to build according to the plan - or have their land compulsorily purchased so that the council can build according to the plan.

I'm not a big fan of compulsory purchases, but I think in this case it would be most justified.
