Are you ready for the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+triennial">Folkestone Triennial</a>? There's a launch event down at the harbour on Saturday 14th, at the <a href="/wiki/ark+cafe">Ark Cafe</a>... what is that then? Did it not burn down? I will have to investigate (where it is, and what is there now, not the actual mysterious fire).

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Folkestone-Triennial-Tales-Time-Space/dp/0954699963/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212560948&sr=8-1">there is also a book</a>, no details on it yet though. please [email=fg@folkestonegerald.com]send me a copy for review[/email], or anything else local.
