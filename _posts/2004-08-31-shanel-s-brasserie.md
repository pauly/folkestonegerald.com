Delighted to see that a phoenix has risen from the flames of <a href="/wiki/kapetan+michales">Kapetan Michales</a>, and it's not a kentucky fried one either. Popped into <a href="/wiki/sharnel+s+brasserie">Sharnel's Brasserie</a> on Saturday for some much needed sustenance on a bank holiday <a href="/wiki/beer+festival">beer festival</a> weekend. We were warmly greeted and successfully seated by one of the owners, and immediately treated to bread rolls and nibbles, olives, pickles and biscuit type things.

We skipped starters (apart from the aforementoned platter) to leave room fordesserts, so straight to the mains. I plumped for the roasted vegetables and my companions chose steaks, well done. Possibly there was a mixup as a result of staff shortages, but it seemsthere was no alternative to the creamy potato side, so my roast veg (seemingly sauteed in wine and herbs) were accompanied only by more veg. Hopefully this will be fixed as we are sure to return.

Puds were simple but tasty, poached pear (singular) for me and cheesecake for the lady. With a couple of drinks each the bill came to less than 20 pounds a head, which is not cheap, but not bad. The welcome was warm, and we hope to return and test the winelist as soon as...
