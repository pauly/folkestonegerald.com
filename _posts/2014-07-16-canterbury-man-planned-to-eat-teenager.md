<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-28313483">Hmm lovely</a>! Nurse <a href="/wiki/dale+bolinger">Dale Bolinger</a> of Canterbury bought an axe in Broadstairs and arranged to meet a teenage girl in Ashford, for the purpose of killing her with the axe and then eating her. I'm only really disappointed that Folkestone does not get a look in in this most kentish <a href="/wiki/cannibalism">cannibalism</a> tale.

Hey Dad where did your <a href="/wiki/thumb">thumb</a> that was <a href="/wiki/amputated">amputated</a> go? Do you recognise this nurse..?
