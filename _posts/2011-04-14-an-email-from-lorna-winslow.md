<blockquote>I just happen to stumble upon this page while searching for something else. I was at Folkestone School of art the same time as you doing the Graphic course. My name is now Llewellyn, not Winslow. I remember John Dyke, John Lucus, Duncan, Ruth, a short guy called Tony, Desmond who I did bump into in London working near Smithfield Market, but we never got around to meeting up also Graham (think that was his name), a tall guy slightly older than the rest of us. Do you remember Sue, I am in contact with her and thats about all. What about John Parson's who taught us one day a week he was always drunk and had greasy hair, he would walk out of the class carrying a large bag and have a swig of something or other on the stairs.

It seems like a lifetime ago now!
