They [s]do[/s] DID something called <a href="/wiki/ceroc">Ceroc</a> at <a href="/wiki/folkestone+pavillion">Folkestone Pavillion</a>, but I have seen a <a href="/wiki/rock+and+roll">rock and roll</a> club at <a href="/wiki/brewery+tap">The Brewery Tap</a> on <a href="/wiki/tontine+street">Tontine Street</a>... good luck.

UPDATE: <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/m/10865/173/RE%3A+Plymouth+Pavillion">Look out, it's no longer there</a>:
<blockquote>we visited the folkestone pavilion to attend the ceroc class but it was all closed up and hasnt hosted the ceroc classes for some months!! i then telephoned their sister restaurand in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> to be told the same thing. please can you amend your details to stop further ceroc fans travelling to the wrong venue on the wrong evening</blockquote>
