The where? The what? The Deck is probably an unfamiliar venue name to most people, but we just got a note pushed through the door advertising their christmas eve and new years parties... what's that added on to the flyer in felt pen after they'd gone to the printers? Oh <a href="/wiki/vasa">Vasa</a>! Why didn't you say it's at <a href="/wiki/bar+vasa">Bar Vasa</a>?

There's a <a href="/wiki/reggae">reggae</a> band and free <a href="/wiki/mulled+wine">mulled wine</a> and mince pies on Christmas eve, if you fancy it. Tickets on sale now for <a href="/wiki/new+year">New Year</a> too.
