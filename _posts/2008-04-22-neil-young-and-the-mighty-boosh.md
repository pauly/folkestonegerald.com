It's all kicking off at the <a href="/wiki/hop+farm">Hop Farm</a> this year isn't it? <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/963952">Neil Young is there on the 6th</a>, and according to the NME, there's a <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">Mighty Boosh</a> festival the same weekend. No tickets on sale for that yet I don't think, so could all be a lie,
[ebay=Mighty Boosh Festival]keep an eye on ebay maybe[/ebay] for <a href="/wiki/booshstock">Booshstock</a> (<a href="/wiki/glastonboosh">Glastonboosh</a>?), but <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/963952">get Neil Young tickets here</a>...
