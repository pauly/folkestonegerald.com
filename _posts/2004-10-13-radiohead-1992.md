I might have seen <a href="/wiki/radiohead">Radiohead</a> in <a href="/misc/gigography/1992/">1992</a>, but not at Canterbury... they played the same venue and month as my mate's band, perhaps they were the support?

Anyone see them in Canterbury?

First time I know I definitely saw them was <a href="/wiki/southampton+guildhall">Southampton Guildhall</a>, with <a href="/wiki/sparklehorse">Sparklehorse</a> in support... I think I won the tickets from somewhere.
