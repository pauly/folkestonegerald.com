Checked out <a href="/wiki/kalala">Kalala</a> at last today, for lunch, 8.98 for an all you can eat Chinese buffet. It was very good, even for a veggie. Plenty of spring rolls, noodle dishes, tofu, vegetables, sauces, and loads of meaty dishes too. Nice to be able to have a pint of real beer (<a href="/wiki/spitfire">Spitfire</a> this time) with lunch too! They also have a salad bar and a range of puds too. Next time we'll try and pace ourselves to fit more in, but it wasn't bad value anyway. Very enjoyable and recommended.
