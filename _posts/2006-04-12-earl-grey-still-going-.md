Popped in The Earl Grey for one too on a bit of a crawl around town on Saturday evening, it's changed style a bit since I last went in there, it's very studenty indeed, though not menacing at all as it has been at points in the past.

The real beer seems to have gone, though that can only be temporary with it being a Shepherd Neame.
