that's all my theories out the window then... From <a href="http://www.mrgig.com">mrgig.com</a>:
<blockquote>The Happy Frenchman is soon to be up and running again under new management!

They will re-open on Thursday 5th October, with bands resuming at the weekend.

Sharon is looking after the bookings and has asked that bands get in touch, (the old gig book was lost so she will be starting from scratch).

Her mobile number is 07913 784550.

Live'N'Kickin will be there on Saturday 7th October so all support will be welcome to get her back on the map with a bang!! </blockquote>
