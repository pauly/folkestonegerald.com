Went to Canterbury yesterday, miserable weather, too wet to hang around but I noticed <a href="/wiki/hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a> has now been renamed <a href="/wiki/black+griffin">The Black Griffin</a>. Was this perhaps the original name of this pub?

There's currently no name on the outside of the pub, don't know if this is by design or it's just unfinished, there is just a fabulous metal black griffin hanging from the front.

Is it still a rock hangout? Or has it been gentrified?
