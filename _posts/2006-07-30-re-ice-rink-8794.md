Ok, I've just found this......what on earth has my opinion got to do with you?  I write something in my personal journal, and you copy and paste it onto here, without my permission, and make me look like an idiot!  You had absolutely no right to post this comment because it has nothing to do with you.  My opinions are my opinions, and even if you wanted to copy a direct quote from me, you should've asked.

I'm sorry if I have offended you in any way, but I don't think i deserved this.
