Guide price <a href="http://www.cliveemson.co.uk/listing_view.asp?Lot=76&Auc=106">200 - 250k with Clive Emson</a>...

The premises comprise a former theatre with office and staff accommodation arranged over four floors and a main auditorium over two storeys. Planning Permission has now been granted for the building to be converted into a three storey indoor market/antiques centre with access from two levels - one at <a href="/wiki/grace+hill">Grace Hill</a> and the second off the car park to the rear via <a href="/wiki/st+eanswythe+way">St Eanswythe Way</a>. The internal area has been completely stripped out in readiness for the proposed works.
