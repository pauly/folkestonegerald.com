Hi there,

I'm Ollie, the lead singer in the Folkestone based Band Realm79. We're currently looking to get more gigs and play in different venues. How would I go about organising an evening of open mic with my band?? we play our own material but only have about 5 songs at the moment but we have many covers from all over the last 5 decades. We can play either acoustically or a full rock set. Check out <a href="http://www.realm79.co.uk">realm79.co.uk</a> for all information on the band.

I look forward to your response

Ollie
