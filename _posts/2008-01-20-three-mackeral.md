i think that the three mackeral is a really nice pub, you always feel welcomed when you arrive, they do the best fish and chips ever you should try them, there beer is great and i think that the people that get in there are really nice to, its just a really nice atmosphere and you dont feel on edge.
people just gave up on the pub when it was nistalgia and the front, but the new people that have taken over it, did have the name of Euphoria but they didnt give up on the pub cos they still own it now, and it is called the Three Mackeral, back to the original name, i really think that if you would like a nice place to eat or drink, go to the three mackeral :)  :)  :)
