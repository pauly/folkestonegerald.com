<a href="http://www.patrickmcguinness.co.uk">Paddy McGuinness</a> star of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A8NYUA/ref=ase_clarkeology-21/203-5984465-8423152">Max and Paddy's Road To Nowhere</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C24J1/">Phoenix Nights</a> brings his show to the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2/Leas%20Cliff%20Hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a> on Monday September 25th. This is apparently your last chance to catch Paddy live on his first solo tour before the DVD is released and he hang up the mic for a wee while... Last chance / first tour / last tour / eh? It's got to be worth a look, though bear in mind it's a 16s and over show, sound like there might be a bit of blue for the dads! Also, I know what you're going to ask, and yes <a href="/wiki/peter+kay">Peter Kay</a> has spontaneously joined him on stage before. This was probably up North though, can't see him trecking all the way down to the coast.
