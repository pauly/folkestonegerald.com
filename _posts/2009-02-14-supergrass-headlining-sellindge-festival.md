<blockquote>It's true  this Valentine's Day we can announce that the legends that are <a href="/wiki/supergrass">SUPERGRASS</a> will be topping the bill at Sellindge Music Festival 2009!

The Oxford heroes, whose sixteen year career has given to the world classics including "Moving", "Pumping on Your Stereo" and Summer anthem "Alright", are set to grace the main stage on Saturday 6th June.

The rest of the main stage line-up will be revealed over the coming weeks, but with a band boasting three platinum-selling albums and countless awards taking the top spot, Sellindge Music Festival is set to be the highlight of the Kent musical calendar!</blockquote>
