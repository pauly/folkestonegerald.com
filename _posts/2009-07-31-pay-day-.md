You might still get advanced tickets from the Leas Cliff Hall, otherwise there will be a ticket office on site, so pay on the door. If you're lucky enough to work for <a href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk">Holiday Extras</a> there's a very special deal available from the social club too. Here's the run down, who's playing:

<blockquote>The mighty <a href="/wiki/feeder">Feeder</a> will be headlining the main stage at this year's Hevy Music Festival, topping an awesome line-up also featuring <a href="/wiki/ash">Ash</a>, <a href="/wiki/gary+numan">Gary Numan</a>, <a href="/wiki/hundred+reasons">Hundred Reasons</a>, <a href="/wiki/blackout">The Blackout</a> (replacing Kids In Glass Houses), <a href="/wiki/attack+attack+">Attack! Attack!</a>, <a href="/wiki/sonic+boom+six">Sonic Boom Six</a> and <a href="/wiki/in+case+of+fire">In Case Of Fire</a>.

Cancer Bats headline our second stage, following We Are The Ocean, The Ghost Of A Thousand (replacing Flood Of Red), The Xcerts, Heartbreak, SHARKS, Farewell City, Mexico Fallz and After The Ordeal.

Finally, LightsGoBlue headline our local talent showcase on the Hevy Music Festival's third stage, following More Than Normal, Amber Room, One Day Elliott, Elephants, The Startover, Kingskin, and Eleven Eleven.</blockquote>
