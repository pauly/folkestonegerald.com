<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/947243/?affiliate=Z755&camefrom=unknown&m3_data=unknown">None left on ticketmaster</a>, anyway so it's [ebay=dirty pretty things]over to ebay[/ebay]! Actually I'd not put them up until a bit nearer the gig, so [ebay=dirty pretty things]try again later[/ebay]...

I see [ebay=feeder tickets]Feeder tickets are up there already[/ebay], even though they've not actually sold out yet...
