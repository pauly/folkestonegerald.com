Just booked in to an <a href="/wiki/italian">Italian</a> we've never been to before, for a birthday meal out... I emailed them and they can do a <a href="/wiki/vegan">vegan</a> no problem, so will see what they come up with and report back! Looking forward to it it looks quite authentic. I might even be able to have the fabled pasta course and THEN a main.
