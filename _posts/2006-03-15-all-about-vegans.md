Giving <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/food_and_drink/reviews/article351374.ece">this article from the Independent</a> a plug here because a) I'm a vegan and b) there's a mention of Folkestone in it!

<blockquote>One of the biggest producers of vegan fare, Plamil Foods, has seen revenues rise by between 10 and 15 per cent a year. Its 30 products are made at its meat and dairy-free factory in Folkestone, Kent</blockquote>

Now back to the music and things...
