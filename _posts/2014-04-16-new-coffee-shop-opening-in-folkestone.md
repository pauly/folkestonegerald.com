Don't think it's a secret but STAY TUNED for more details. 

In other opening / closing news, read in the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> that <a href="/wiki/hub">The Hub</a> is closing. The <a href="/wiki/cycle+shop">cycle shop</a> is going anyway, don't know how this affects <a href="/wiki/loaf">Loaf</a> cafe which is connected.
