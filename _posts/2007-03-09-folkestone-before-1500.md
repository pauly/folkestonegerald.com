The Folkestone People's History Centre is inviting local people to take part in an exciting new heritage project called "A Town Unearthed: Folkestone Before 1500".

Residents of Folkestone and the local media are invited to find out about the project at a presentation, 'Archaeology and Community' to be presented at 6.30 pm in the Sassoon Gallery, Folkestone Library.  A Town Unearthed' is a
five year archaeology project which seeks to explain and record the early history of the town. The project will focus on a number of sites around the town and it is hoped that the community, schools and local groups will play an important role in the rediscovery of the ancient history of the town and participate in a range of activities including 'test pits surveys', field walking, re-enactment days, guided site visits and archaeological open days.

The Folkestone People's History is run by Canterbury Christ Church University and has the support of The Creative Foundation, Shepway District Council, Folkestone Town Council, Kent County Council Arts and Libraries, local schools, historians and archaeological services.

Canterbury Christ Church University's Dr Lesley Hardy, heads up The Folkestone People's History Centre.  Dr Hardy said: "Folkestone is rich in
archaeological remains dating back to the Bronze Age and the project proposes to uncover and
record the fascinating early history of the town.  We very much welcome the participation of the public at every step of the way and we are sure
that anyone with an interest in archaeology, history or the origins of the town will
want to take part."

The evening will begin with a presentation by local archaeologist Dr Andrew Richardson and will be followed by a discussion. Refreshments will be
available.

If you would like to attend please contact The Folkestone People's History Centre at 67, The Old High Street, Folkestone, or telephone 01303
850614.
