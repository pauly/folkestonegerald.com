<a href="/wiki/creative+players">The Creative Players</a> is an amateur dramatics group forming as part of the creative renaissance of Folkestone. At the moment we need help, idea's and feedback from like-minded souls who believe as we do that Folkestone can sustain, indeed heartily support a new dramatic group in the town.
 
We need help with the following:
 
We need firstly a premises to rehearse in twice a week (and possibly perform in too) preferably free of charge or at a reduced rate and with a stage!
 
Help with costume, both storage and otherwise.
 
A pianist who is willing to give there time (and patience!) as well as use of an instrument (electric piano).
 
A make up artist (someone to help with)
 
Idea's and feedback for promotion.
 
Members of all ages to make the project a reality.
 
Possible help with running a bar during the performance nights.
 
Help with cost's, advertising revenue, competiton idea's, raffles etc.
 
We may have missed the boat for producing an autumn production but certainly with the right support and creative involvement a tongue in cheek self written Pantomime is a real possibility. These things take time to produce/direct etc etc (usually about 3 months from start to finish). But Im open to all suggestions regarding doing productions in a shorter space of time. Lets be different, challenging and above all creative.
 
Together we can bring Dramatic performance on a regular basis to the quarter, to Folkestone! To compliment and possibly work with that which already exists in the town. I can envisage outside performances in the high street, the harbour area and of course the brilliant amphitheatre! as well as indoor productions once a regular rehearsal space can be found.
 
Membership will include a quartely newsletter and membership card, free cudlly toy and drink of squash!
