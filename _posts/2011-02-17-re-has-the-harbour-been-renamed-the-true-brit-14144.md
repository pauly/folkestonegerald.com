I popped in recently for a drink down there with my wife and its quite nice. There are a few things that need finishing, but that's kind of expected for a refurb. They are supposedly re-opening the restaurant soon as well which I think will help change the image of the pub.

With regards to the down-sizing of the pub, its just a temporary measure. I got told that within about 3-6 months they will be opening the other half which will house live bands on a frequent basis.

p.s. they do have a few real ales)
