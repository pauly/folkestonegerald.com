Hello There, 
I am the general manager of the Sixty Six , My name is Charlotte.
I was very disappointed to see this review of The Sixty Six.

As most people are aware, the restaurant is fairly new, I would like to point out that the majority of new restaurants will have a few hiccups within the first couple of weeks of service. I personally believe all these are learning curves and the whole of our team of staff take every positive and negative comment on board. We greatly appreciate any constructive criticism from customers who have had a meal in the restaurant and strive to relinquish any issue that is brought to us.

We now have new methods of cooking our thrice cooked chips which has hopefully solved the complaints towards this particular part of the menu.

I would like to recommend that people reading this review experience The Sixty Six SteaK House themselves and in turn cast their own opinions. 

We are a great restaurant with a lot of atmosphere and a lot to give. A family run business and always aiming to provide a homely and inviting reception. 

So far, the majority of the feedback has been incredible and really pleasing to hear. If I am honest, Yes there have been negative comments towards certain aspects of the restaurant, however as soon as we have received these comments we  are quick on our heels to overcome them.

Again I do apologise for your recent experience and appreciate you giving us a second chance to change your mind!


Thank you
