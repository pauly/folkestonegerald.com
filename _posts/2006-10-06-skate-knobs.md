That's the menu board from The Hermitage... If you were going to go to the bother of messing with their board, surely you'd change that to "Peasant Pate" too?

Aha <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Skate" title="All about Skate on wikibooks.org">from wikibooks</a>:
<blockquote>skate knobs. Stop giggling. These are balls of flesh from the cheeks of the fish. They are easily and quickly cooked by shallow frying.</blockquote>
