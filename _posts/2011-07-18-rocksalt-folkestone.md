After the much vaunted arrival of Folkestone's newest restaurant the wife and I decided to give Rocksalt a try and I must say we were pleasantly surprised.

Firstly, a quick word on Rocksalt's aspect. Most seats in the restaurant will give you a panoramic view of the harbour so, if you're like me and love to eat while enjoying a sea view then you won't be disappointed however, having said that you certainly don't go to a restaurant just to look at boats bobbing up and down.

The menu at Rocksalt is original and impressive, as are the daily specials, and the wine list should suit most tastes and pockets.

I had the Potted Crayfish Tails to start followed by a very reasonably priced and extremely tasty  Rib Eye Steak cooked exactly how I asked it to be cooked (medium/well done).

My wife had a Tankard of Grilled Prawns to start with Kentish Lamb Rump as the main dish. Now my wife is a fussy eater but she loved both dishes and although I was more than happy with my own selection I have to say a little bit of "Food Envy" did creep in, enough to convince me what to have next time.

We shared a selection of vegetables which were priced separately at 2.50 but as the portions were quite generous I've no real complaints there.

We finished off with a Selection of Kent and Sussex Artisan Cheeses for "she-who-likes-a-cheeseboard" and I had a Selection of Rocksalt Ice Creams (homemade of course), both were presented and tasted as good as the previous offerings.

This was all washed down with the house Rose which was more than just palatable but a tad expensive to be classed as the "casa vino" at 19.00 although it was of a very good quality and would probably be at the top end of wine lists at less impressive restaurants.

The final bill came to 120, which also included a service charge of 12.5% a bit steep you might say but, with the level of service we got on the night, I would argue that it was probably well worth it.  

So, would I go back again? Absolutely, my wife now cites Rocksalt as "her favourite restaurant" and I have to say it's well near the top of my list too however, I would categorise it as a venue for high days, holidays, and special occasions which probably makes our next visit something to really look forward to.
