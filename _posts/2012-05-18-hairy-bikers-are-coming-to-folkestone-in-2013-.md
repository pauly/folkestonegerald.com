Tickets On Sale TODAY!

<blockquote>Saturday 16 March 2013, 25.00

<a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a>, <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>

It's now been over two years since we did our last stage tour, a complete sell-out and one of the best times of our lives. It's for those reasons that we can't wait to do it all over again; only this time it's going to be bigger, bolder, funnier, and packed with more food and laughs than ever before. We like to do things a little differently to most, which is why we're not just giving you a show, we're giving you a real night out. There will be some cooking, a sprinkling of special guests* you all know and love, and a chance for some of our lucky audience members to enjoy a slap up meal on stage courtesy of the (Hairy) chefs.

Last time round we told you our story, but this time, we're taking you round the world. Starting with our northern roots, we'll share our rip roaring tales of decadent do's, big dinners and culinary catastrophes. There will be a bit of dancing, a bit of flirting, a bit of singing, and some downright hilarious stand-up comedy. Filled with plenty of surprises, expect the unexpected and if you like us on the telly, you will love us Larger than Live.

Tickets will be available from the Leas Cliff Hall box office in person, by phone on 0844 871 3015 or online at www.atgtickets.com/folkestone</blockquote>
