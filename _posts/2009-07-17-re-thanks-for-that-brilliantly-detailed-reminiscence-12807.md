Hi Pauly.... Sorry but my brain's a little befuddled about exact dates.  However, I can tell you that it would have bee arounf the period [year]1970[/year]-[year]1971[/year]-ish to around [year]1976[/year]-[year=1977]77[/year]ish?  During this period I was also in a local (<a href="/wiki/dover">Dover</a>) band myself: "<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=father+luke">Father Luke</a>" - We headlined at the Leas twice on local-band-nights which were promoted by <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=andy+macpherson">Andy MacPherson</a>, if I remember rightly?  These 'local' nights used to be quite a regular occurrance and featured bands from all around Kent such as: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=back+van+nasty">Back Van Nasty</a>; <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=barnacle">Barnacle</a>; <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dead+dogs+don+t+lie">Dead Dogs Don't Lie</a>... We also supported "The Pirates" at the Leas ('post' <a href="/wiki/johnny+kidd">Johnny Kidd</a>) in their nouvau-punk era, and played in and around London; <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=music+machine+covent+garden">The Music Machine, Covent Garden</a>; <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hornsey+art+college">Hornsey Art College</a>; <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cartoon+croydon">The Cartoon, Croydon</a> and various and many other non-descript pubs etc., as well as in and around Kent in paid and unpaid gigs; like many other local rock bands who were 'chasing-the-dream!'  We also won the Southern heat of the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=melody+maker">Melody Maker</a> Competition at <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a>, getting through to the competition Final at the <a href="/wiki/marquee+club+wardour+street">Marquee Club, Wardour Street</a> in London (around [year]1978[/year]-[year=1979]79[/year], I think?) where we were 'trounced' by the eclectically brilliant band: "<a href="/wiki/splodgednessabounds">Splodgednessabounds</a>" and their anarchic song: "<a href="/wiki/two+pints+of+lager+and+a+packet+of+crisps+please">Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, please</a>!" 

Hey-ho! Annother one of life's 'moments' or 'If only!' - Still never mind eh?  It was a great period of my life not only for what I did but for the 'time' itself... Fantastic music; amazing bands and musicians and great friends...

Going back a bit to my earlier post and a consequent reply.... Yes, the Skid Row I referred to WAS the one 'a la Gary Moore' - However, Skid Row were NOT the forerunner of <a href="/wiki/thin+lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>.. According to Gary Moore, on last week's Planet Rock Radio, he was playing with Skid Row and was asked, during a break from Skid Row, to replace the guitarist from Lizzy who played on the Whiskey in the Jar single who couldn't make (not sure of the reason?) a subsequent American Tour.

 Moore rehearsed with Lizzy (he was only around 17 or 18 at the time, I think he said?); was 'picked' and did the tour and then went back to Skid Row upon his return to the UK.  It was only some time after this that he eventually joined <a href="/wiki/thin+lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>.

There ya go!

Great site and great to see that there are some other old (Prog) rockers still out there... Maybe some younger ones too?
