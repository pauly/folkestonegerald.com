<a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> teased it on the twitter that a Folkestone venue was to reopen, I have not seen the paper, what was the venue? I guess it's just <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a> again, but I suppose it could be something more interesting. Maybe <a href="/wiki/jolsons">Jolsons</a> now the <a href="/wiki/creative+foundation">Creative Foundation</a> have taken it on. Or <a href="/wiki/pipers">Pipers</a>?
