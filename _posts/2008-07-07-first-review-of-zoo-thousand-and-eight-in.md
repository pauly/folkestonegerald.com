<a href="http://www.safeconcerts.com/newsitem.asp?nurn=1693">Here</a> at <a href="http://www.safeconcerts.com">safeconcerts.com</a>, sounds a bit chaotic, more rumours of cancellations than actual cancellations possibly though.

<a href="http://www.safeconcerts.com/newsitem.asp?nurn=1692">More here</a>, seems <a href="/wiki/lethal+bizzle">Lethal Bizzle</a> was promoted to replace <a href="/wiki/dizzee+rascal">Dizzee Rascal</a>, not a bad call I wouldn't have said, though one was a Mercury prize winner and the other is a one hit wonder.

UPDATE: hearing more reports from people who were there, sounds it was chaos, but the bands who were good made the day. Get in touch if you had a different experience.

UPDATE UPDATE: <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/speakout/view_topic.asp?topic_recid=50">many many many negative comments here</a>! Surprisingly none on the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.zoothousand.com/forum">official zoo thousand forum</a> - did it crash under the weight of complaints or was it removed?

Some more comments <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/m/11391/Zoo+thousand+and+HATE+">here on the blog</a>. Guess you won't be queuing up to by tickets for next year then!
