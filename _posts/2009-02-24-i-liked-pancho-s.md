The owners were Scottish weren't they? That was our restaurant of choice at that time, since it closed nothing has survived for very long in that building.

<a href="/wiki/kai+s">Kai's</a>, that's another one I miss, that was good, and that building is still empty. Did you ever go there? Right by <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/73/The+Red+Lion">The Red Lion</a>.
