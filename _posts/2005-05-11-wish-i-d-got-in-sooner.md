I found out the flat I bought was half the price the last time it sold, two years before I bought it... two years before that it was probably free!

Not sure about "Folky" though, it sounds a bit like old fogey... we're trying to encourage 'Stoney as a shortened form, reckon it'll work? It's a bit contrived I know...
