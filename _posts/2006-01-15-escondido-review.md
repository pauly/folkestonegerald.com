Don't know how we got the impression this place wasn't going to be good, it was very nice indeed. Escondido is a modern Mexican influence restaurant where <a href="/wiki/la+bougie">La Bougie</a> used to be. It's got a clean and cool look, and looks just the sort of place I'd like to see more of.

Clare had the fillet steak and I went for polenta. Mine tasted a tiny bit over fried, but it was a good sized portion with a nice fresh lime and herb dressing. The menu's not huge, this means they can concentrate on what they do well, good plan. They do have room for a few vege options, again a good thing. 

With a bottle of wine our bill came to forty five pounds. Recommended, we will return.
