Does Folkestone really need any more apartments? I know it has lots of pubs and they're all empty, but that's because there are almost none that are worth going to.

I heard somewhere, perhaps on the councillor's own blog that he lived there, and that he'd lived there as a child (if I'm thinking of the right person) but I didn't know he was the landlord / tenant. Also, I didn't know that <a href="/wiki/euphoria">Euphoria</a> was meant to be a gay bar, I usually avoid those pre-club type places. Haven't been in there at all since it's been the <a href="/wiki/three+mackeral">Three Mackeral</a> I don't think, though I think we got as far as the front door in each of its last three or four incarnations and just thought "no thanks" and gone somewhere else. 

We had a drink outside there once in the daytime when it was <a href="/wiki/euphoria">Euphoria</a>, when the sun is shining it's a nice spot, but the last time I really liked it was when it was called <a href="/wiki/front">The Front</a>, though I don't think that survived long either did it?

Which previous landlord are you then? Or are you the landlord of a neighbouring rival tavern? They're all pretty ropey down there.
