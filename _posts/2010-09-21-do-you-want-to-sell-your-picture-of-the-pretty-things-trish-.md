Long time no speak! I tried to email, but the address I have bounced... <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/54150592@N06/">Brice</a> emailed me to say:

Hi Paul,

I'm 34 years old and I live in the south of France with my girlfriend and my daughter. I'm a big fan and collector of the PRETTY THINGS. I have more of 300 LPs, 300 singles/EPs, 400 CDs, more of 400 photos, magazine,..etc...
I see your 3 photos and I would like to know if you are interested to sell them. Maybe you have negatives. And I'm ready to pay a lot.
Please, I'm very interested so let me know.
Thanks
Best wishes,
Brice</blockquote>

I have no way to get in touch with them other than via Flickr though...
