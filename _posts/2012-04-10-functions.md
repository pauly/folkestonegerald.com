My son and daughter in law had their reception at Vasa.  They paid for catering for 50 people but the food provided only covered a maximum of 30 servings.  At least 20 guests went hungry.  We have tried to liaise with the management on at least 3 occasions, but they just don't want to know.  Very sad really.  Good money paid, but little back for it.
