My mum used to go out with <a href="/wiki/noel+redding">Noel Redding</a> way back in the 60's so I can confirm that Hendrix played in Folkestone, but not in <a href="/wiki/tofts">Tofts</a> as everybody guesses she says vaguely that it was a social club on <a href="/wiki/grace+hill">Grace Hill</a>, but I quote "Don't ask me the name it was the bloody sixties".

Personally I was at the "Dead or Alive" Leas gig where "slam dancing" offically started according to the press (well it got into the Sun so it must be true).
