Surprisingly it's not any of the <a href="/wiki/creative+foundation">creative foundation</a> or anyone connected with <a href="/wiki/roger+de+haan">Roger De Haan</a>, it's <a href="http://metalpelican.blogspot.com/2007/09/id-consult-grammar-school-kids.html">the boy who writes this blog</a>, he invented it for a laugh while he was at school.
