<blockquote>As the days get shorter and the evenings darker, the Light Before Christmas prepares to illuminate Folkestones Creative Quarter.

Saturday the 20th December will see an illuminated procession through the streets of Folkestone, down the Old High Street and into the Harbour Area for a lively arts market and Christmas songs. Illuminations, music, live window performances and displays will entertain you on this festive evening. Brought to you by Tonic - a creative business project held at the University Centre Folkestone and funded by the Kent and Medway Lifelong Learning Network. The objective of the project is to increase footfall into the Creative Quarter and help to promote the work of local artists.
