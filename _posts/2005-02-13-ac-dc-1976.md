I saw <a href="/wiki/ac+dc">AC/DC</a> in <a href="/wiki/1976">1976</a> and <a href="/wiki/ac+dc">AC/DC</a> didnt play. I travelled down from <a href="/wiki/gravesend">Gravesend</a>. I believe that the gig was cancelled by the council who didnt agree with Angus dropping his shorts!!! The replacement act was <a href="/wiki/real+thing">The Real Thing</a> (and they weren't)
