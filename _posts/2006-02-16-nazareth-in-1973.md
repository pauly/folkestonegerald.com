Bit of anecdotal gig history from <a href="http://www.nazarethdirect.co.uk">Nazareth Direct</a>... hanging off the ceiling? Really?

"When 'Broken Down Angel' took off, it happened really quickly. At the start of our first headlining tour, with Robin Trower supporting, we played to about 300 folk. We pulled the car onto the hard shoulder when we heard it on the wireless  and I cant believe I just called it the wireless, either!  for the first time. We did Top Of The Pops, and a week later a gig at Leas Cliff Hill in Folkestone was so rammed the fans were hanging from the ceiling."

Don't have the actual date of this gig, anyone help?
