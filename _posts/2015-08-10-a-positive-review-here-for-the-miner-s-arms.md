Sounds a reasonable review there, I've been there a few times most notably on my pre <a href="/wiki/stag+do">stag do</a> night out. A nice little pub for beer, I wouldn't expect anything too fancy from the food, can't remember if they have anything for me. <a href="http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/what-s-on/eating-out/carol-godsmark-reviews-the-miner-s-arms-funtley-near-fareham-1-6883626">From the news</a>.
