yo,

I've designed some t-shirts, for us to remember the crazy earthquake in Folkestone on 28/04/07. Luckily, nobody was killed or seriously hurt, just damage to houses, and here's hoping people's properties are back to how they were before the Quake asap.

They will be available in all sizes, mens, womens, kids style shirts, and in a ton of colours.

Check them out here :

I have some samples coming back from the printers, so they will be up in the gallery <a href="http://www.thegrocerygallery.com">thegrocerygallery.com</a> on the weekend, and available on <a href="http://www.playdontplay.com">playdontplay.com</a> very soon.
