Doesn't really look like it's up to speed, but it reopened on the second. Good to see these premises in use again. We're visiting on Friday, so will report back. Menu looks a bit pub grub at first glance...

<a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> is Spanish for "Hidden" and is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&q=Escondido,+CA">a place in South California</a>, maybe that gives a tip off as to the kind of food that will be served.
