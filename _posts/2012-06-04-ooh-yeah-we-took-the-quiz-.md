Shame it was quieter than normal (the only times I get to go to the <a href="/wiki/chambers+quiz">Chambers quiz</a> it is crazy rammed and hectic) but perhaps that worked in our favour. We won the Chambers quiz last night, and took a cash prize, very nice.

If there had been more people there the pot would have been bigger, but if there had been more people there we may not have won.
