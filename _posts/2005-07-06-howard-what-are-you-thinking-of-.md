In <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4652533.stm">this report from the BBC</a>, <a href="/wiki/michael+howard">Michael Howard</a> has challenged Monsieur Chirac to EAT IN FOLKESTONE!!!

"I'd like him to come to my constituency, over to Folkestone and Hythe, and I'll take him to some restaurants that will match anything he can see in France", he said... 

Which restaurants are these Michael? Where are they hiding?
