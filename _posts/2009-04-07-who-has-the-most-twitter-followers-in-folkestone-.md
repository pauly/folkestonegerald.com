<a href="http://twitterholic.com/top100/followers/bylocation/Folkestone%2C+Kent%2C+UK/">See the full list</a> on <a href="http://twitterholic.com">twitterholic.com</a>, it's mostly political round here. I don't mean "I'm not following them because they're not following so and so", I mean it really is mostly political, it's all the lib dems taking up most of the slots. Not that there is a lot of heavy usage in this area.

Just posting this really to mark how things looked on this day, I will be back in a month's time see how it's changed... I'm not doing anything to try and build up <a href="http://twitter.com/pauly">my personal account</a> but we might see <a href="http://twitter.com/folkestone">twitter.com/folkestone</a> doing a bit better I think.

<a href="http://twitterholic.com/top100/followers/bylocation/Kent%2C+UK/ Here's the lsit for all of Kent]], it's mostly people who are following more people than are following them. Perhaps we should be ranking these people by their <a href="http://twitterratio.com">twitter ratio</a> instead, see how things look then? No need to point out who storms ahead with a score of 52 while the current leader is not even in whole numbers :-) It shows the superstars from the needy self promoters anyway... Yes, I do plan on making <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">The 'Gerald</a>" title="Folkestone Gerald">a needy self promoter, so putting my personal account up to number one in the ratio chart. Number 1 spot here [[http://www.folkestonegerald.com we</a> come (fingers crossed).
