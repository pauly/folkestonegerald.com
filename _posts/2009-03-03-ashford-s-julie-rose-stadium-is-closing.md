But there a little girl who is working very hard to keep it open...

<i>(reposted from something I was sent at work)</i>

Alexandra Pricket is 8 years old and has already won numerous awards in athletics, running cross country, fun runs and plenty of other athletic events. She has been able to do this using her own raw talent and the help of the staff and her friends at the Julie Rose Stadium. She loves running and being active and has huge potential in the field for the future. Now comes the bad news; The Julie Rose Stadium is due to close and Alex would like to ask you all a small favour.

<blockquote>Is it ok if I put your names on <a href="http://emmabates.wufoo.com/forms/please-dont-shut-down-the-julie-rose-stadium/">a petition to try to stop them closing the Julie Rose Stadium</a> because I love going there and I love running there and if they close it I wont have anywhere to go and run.

Thank you very much

Love from Alexandra Prickett</blockquote>

The  stadium was build in memory of another very talented <a href="/wiki/ashford">Ashford</a> athlete, Julie Rose, who, unable to train anywhere near her home, flew to America to develop her career further. Whilst travelling on an internal flight to an athletics event, the plane crashed and Julie sadly died. Her parents, with the support of thousands of other supporters raised enough cash through their hard work and determination to get the Julie Rose Stadium erected.

600 children are enroled in the stadium's various activities every week. Without a training ground we will sadly lose much of this undeveloped talent before it has even begun.

Please help Alexandra keep the stadium open for us and future generations to enjoy. All we ask is that you fill our your name and address on the following form. None of your personal details will be disclosed to anyone apart from the people who wil be making the decision next week whether to close the stadium for good or not.

We don't want any money, just a few seconds of your time.

Thank you
