I went past "Luxor Casino Bingo" near <a href="/wiki/tontine+street">Tontine Street</a> at the weekend, is it just bingo, or is it really a casino? Doesn't seem likely.

Personally I wouldn't be too worried about a casino being in the area, is there any reason to be?

Guessing the casino in the story above is not part of Roger DeHaan's masterplan, it'll be part of Jimmy Godden's Benidormesque hotel complex.
