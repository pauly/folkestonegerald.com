Gerald - 'tis Geordie George if U R da right guy...we used 2 jam @ my house in Cheriton and urs too - with a beer an a smoke! I also had young Paul as a learner...haha, my son Daniels' friend from school to ...erm...teach! 16 yrs on - and my boys (men now!) have managed to contact young - at the time - PAUL MINTER. This was done thru Facebook I hear, and Paul asked my Gary 'How's ya dad' or summit... it has been alleged that Paul now has a recording studio in Wales - where the beer is good & cheep!

Is this the very same Paul Minter from Cheriton (lived with mam & dad behind the big pub near Cheriton High St but on left on way to town). He should be aged about 29 - 30 yrs now, bless him, he's really getting on now!

Let me know as I would enjoy a riff or two someday - he could probably show me how an AXE works!

Kind regards

George (Geordie)
