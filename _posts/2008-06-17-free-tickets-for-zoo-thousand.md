You can get in free to ZooThousand and other festivals if you work as a volunteer... <a href="http://www.festivalvolunteer.co.uk">festivalvolunteer.co.uk</a> for more details. Let me know how you get on.

If you don't want to you can <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/venue/279177/">buy tickets here</a>, still some left. Seen lots of special offers for tickets locally, so there's a chance of other people being given free tickets I think, so [ebay=zoo thousand]well worth a look on here[/ebay] for tickets being sold at less than face value...
