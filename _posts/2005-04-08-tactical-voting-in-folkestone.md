At least one Labour party member, David Finnitch, 70, from Folkestone, has been won over to the idea of tactical voting, because he says there is "no chance" of the party winning in his constituency - so he may as well try to get the sitting MP, Tory leader <a href="/wiki/michael+howard">Michael Howard</a>, out instead.

"If the majority of Labour voters would pull over, and top up with the Lib Dems, we can move Michael Howard out of this area, I'm convinced of that," <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4421237.stm">he told BBC News</a>...
