<a href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Yobs-break-street-cleaner_s-arm-newsinkent5417.aspx">Reprinting from Kent news</a>, hopefully they'll get a result, are there not CCTV cameras all over the Leas?

<blockquote>POLICE are appealing for help identifying a group of youths who assaulted and hurled abuse at a street cleaner.

The 62-year-old broke his arm when he was pushed over by one of the yobs on the zig zag path near <a href="/wiki/leas">The Leas</a> in Folkestone on Friday.

The incident happened at around 10.15am. The main offender is described as a white male aged 15 or 16, six feet two inches tall and of slim build with short fair hair.

He was wearing a blue tracksuit with a blue stripe on the arms and trainers.

Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call PC Scott McKillop on 01303 850055, or Kent Crimestoppers on 0800 555111</blockquote>
