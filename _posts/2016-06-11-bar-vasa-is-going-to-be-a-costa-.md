Seems an odd move to me, it's going to have to be more than a normal train station / service station type thing surely.

UPDATE: It seems to have been bought by <a href="/wiki/whitbread">Whitbread</a>, the owners of <a href="/wiki/costa">Costa</a>. They own <a href="/wiki/costa+coffee">Costa Coffee</a>, but also <a href="/wiki/premier+inn">Premier Inn</a>, <a href="/wiki/beefeater">Beefeater</a>, <a href="/wiki/brewers+fayre">Brewers Fayre</a>, <a href="/wiki/table+table">Table Table</a> and <a href="/wiki/taybarns">Taybarns</a>. I think they used to own more, I worked for <a href="/wiki/beefeater">Beefeater</a> a long time ago and there were other places in the group that we could get a discount for.
