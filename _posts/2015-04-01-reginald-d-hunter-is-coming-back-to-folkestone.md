Small show, a warm up at the cheese grater, 26th April. Tickets on sale 10am 2nd April (I hope it's not an april fool). Bet tickets have gone by the time you read this, hope we get some...

He's been here before at the <a href="/wiki/lonestar">Lonestar</a> comedy, did you know? That's the place to see the big names before they're big names I'd say, but this is VERY NICE that we can see the big names after they're big names, but still in a close up venue.
