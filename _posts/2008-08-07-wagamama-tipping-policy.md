<blockquote>we do not include a service charge and when people leave a tip, 100% of the money goes to our staff - they are the ones who earn it, and theyre the ones who should receive it! our staff are also paid national minimum wage or more and we do not use tips to meet the national minimum wage requirements. for more info, <a href="http://www.wagamama.com/latest/news/from/wagamama/55">click here</a></blockquote>

Nice to know.
