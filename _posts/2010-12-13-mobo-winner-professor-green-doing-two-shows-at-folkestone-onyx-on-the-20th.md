MOBO Award Winner, Professor Green, will be keeping himself busy in the Christmas week. The 20th and 21st December will see the star perform not once, but twice on each date at Onyx Nightclubs in Folkestone and Shrewsbury. It all starts at 6.30pm with the under 18s events, and then later in the evening the over 18s After Parties are set to kick off at 10pm with extra exclusive performances from the Professor.

Littering his lyrics with wry pop culture references, a sharp sense of humour and an honesty rarely found in rap music right now, don't miss the opportunity to catch this amazing artist in person, performing hit songs like 'I Need You Tonight', 'Just Be Good To Green', 'Monster' and 'Jungle'.</blockquote>
