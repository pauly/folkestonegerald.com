<blockquote>Train operator Southeastern is linking the suspension of its carriages to a computer system that works out the weight of passengers getting on at each station. Other rail firms are installing laser beams across carriage doors to count exactly how many people board each service.

Southeastern, which carries 200,000 commuters in and out of London during the morning peak, operates the region's two most congested rail services - the 8.03am Orpington to Charing Cross service and the 6.32am from Folkestone Central to Cannon Street.</blockquote>

How long before fatties have to pay double?
