i have had enough with people who dont need to be on the doll being on it!im tired of working my butt of and just seeing people pop out kids just to get on the doll...i have seen so many youths on the doll and even some of my so called friends but thats it!i think something should be done to push them into work as theres loads of jobs everywhere and why should i pay for them to sirt on their arse!!!!
