Local <a href="/wiki/ukip">ukip</a> <a href="/wiki/candidate">candidate</a> is not looking good right now, after her chief of staff <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-31982168">appeared to be doing something suspicious with expenses</a> in a Kent restaurant. Heard this on the <a href="/wiki/radio+4">radio 4</a> this morning and obviously our thought was "which restaurant?". It's not actually that local, it's <a href="/wiki/margate">Margate</a>. <a href="/wiki/janice+atkinson">Janice Atkinson</a> is intending to stand as <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> and <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> candidate in the election, but hopefully she is now scuppered and that will throw <a href="/wiki/ukip">ukip</a>'s local plans into disarray.
