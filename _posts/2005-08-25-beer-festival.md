Is there one this weekend? <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/beer/festivals.shtml">Beer in the evening</a> has nothing, and Chambers seems to be quite in with them at the moment, mentioning their URL (instead of the uber loyal <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">folkestonegerald.com</a>), so anyone know anything? Been working hard all week and stayed in London last night so no idea if there's anything going on. Come on, it's a bank holiday weekend, there's got to be something to do in town! Off to check <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">the calendar</a>...
