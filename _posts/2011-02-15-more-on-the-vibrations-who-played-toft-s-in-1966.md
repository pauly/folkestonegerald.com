Got my original info from <a href="http://www.collecting-tull.com/MartinBarre.html">this page</a> on <a href="http://www.collecting-tull.com">collecting-tull.com</a> but now <a href="http://www.garagehangover.com">garagehangover.com</a> have this page about <a href="http://www.garagehangover.com/?q=NoblemenUK">The Noblemen</a> which has more info:

<blockquote>The group backs <a href="/wiki/vibrations">The Vibrations</a> at <a href="/wiki/toft+s">Toft's</a> in Folkestone, Kent. Former <a href="/wiki/loving+kind">Loving Kind</a> guitarist <a href="/wiki/noel+redding">Noel Redding</a> joins the musicians backstage after the show. Little does he know but his future band leader <a href="/wiki/jimi+hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> is flying out from the USA tonight on route for London.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.Garagehangover.com">Garagehangover.com</a> looks to be a great site if you're interested in the bands of the <a href="/wiki/1960">1960</a>s. There's a great scan of a <a href="/wiki/toft+s">Toft's</a> poster / flyer there too.

If anyone has anything to share on old <a href="/wiki/gigs+in+folkestone">gigs in Folkestone</a>, please get in touch.

UPDATE: I only really meant for this to appear on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">Folkestone Gerald</a> but I made a change to my blog recently so it posts new stories I write there, or on my <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com">family tree</a> page, up here. I'm sure it won't actually bother anyone...
