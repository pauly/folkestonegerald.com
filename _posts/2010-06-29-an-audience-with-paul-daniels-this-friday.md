[s]If you didn't make it to Ozzy Osbourne this week why not console yourselves with this, at the Quarterhouse? I think it could be funny for entirely unintended reasons. In fact, I think  it could be (wait for it) MAGIC![/s]

OH don't bother according to @ThePaulDaniels it is cancelled! I wonder how many tickets they sold???
