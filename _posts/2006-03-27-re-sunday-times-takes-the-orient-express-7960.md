You can see it rumble into Folkestone Harbour every (Thursday, I think?) lunchtime. A magnificent sight. It always amuses me that these folk, who have splashed out on this most exotic mode of transport have to decamp from their luxury train onto possibly Britains most run down station! From what I understand, Mr de Haan intends to rip the tracks up as part of the refurb and the train will terminate up at the tunnel station? So check it out while you can...
