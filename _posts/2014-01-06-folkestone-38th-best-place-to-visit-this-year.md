Not 38th best place in Shepway, or even in Kent, but <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jan/03/holiday-hotspots-where-to-go-in-2014">IN THE WORLD</a> according to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a>.

<blockquote> 38. Folkestone, UK

Beyond the town's shabby (but improving) seafront, a grassroots arts scene has bubbled into a fully-fledged movement. Buoyed by the renaissance of nearby <a href="/wiki/hastings">Hastings</a> and <a href="/wiki/margate">Margate</a>, the work of its artisans is now celebrated in the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+triennial">Folkestone Triennial</a>. The event, curated by <a href="/wiki/lewis+biggs">Lewis Biggs</a>, formerly of <a href="/wiki/tate+liverpool">Tate Liverpool</a>, returns for a third time from 30 August-2 November. Works will be shown in public spaces such as the <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter">Creative Quarter</a>, a colourful area of shops, studios and cafes, and a picturesque symbol of the town's changing mood.</blockquote>

All down to the <a href="/wiki/triennial">Triennial</a> and the people doing the press for that, rather than the campaigning of the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald">'Gerald</a>.
