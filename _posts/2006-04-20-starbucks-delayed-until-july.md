Further to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/folkestone/80/73//As-one-store-closes.html my earlier comments about Starbucks]], today's Herald has it that the store won't be opening until July now... do you think we put them off with the comments here? It also says in the paper that the <a href="/wiki/ciro+citterio">Ciro Citterio</a>" title="did they only get that from here | That was my guess for where the store would go last week">store opposite Debenhams is the front runner for the location, hmm, [[Ciro Citterio</a>? That's the second time something's appeared here first, it's nice to know that the good people of Folkestone are reading!

I took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/folkestonegerald/archives/date-taken/2006/04/20/" title="See my pictures...">a walk around the town today</a> to see if there was any progress, and things seemed to have sped up a little along <a href="/wiki/rendezvous+street">Rendezvous Street</a>, could that be the spot? Anyone else any ideas?
