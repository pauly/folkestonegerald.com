James Goddon, is a decent man, a loyal friend, who if he gave you his word would stick to it no matter what. He employed a great number of people, and was  loyal to Folkestone, it is just a shame Shepway council did not show him some respect.

The town needs stars, people that shine out, that lead, and strangely that care.

The rumour mill does not grind truth
