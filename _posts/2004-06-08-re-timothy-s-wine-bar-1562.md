Surely, if you run a restaurant -especially one in London  you should be used to all reviews; glowing or otherwise. You have done yourself no favours with a reply like that. You've obviously admitted there was a mix up, things could have been handled better, so why the less than polite reply? Is that what we can expect if we dont like the service in your restaurant; sharp words and a request never to darken your culinary doorstep again?

The old adage of the customer is always right can never fail.
