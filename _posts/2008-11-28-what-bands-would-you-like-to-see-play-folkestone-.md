Interesting and mysterious, someone has a reason for asking <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/11766/RE%3A+Thanks+for+chipping+in+on+the+site+anyway">in this thread</a> what bands would you like to come to Folkestone..? Anyone care to chip in? Being at least vaguely realistic, I nominate <a href="/wiki/magic+numbers">The Magic Numbers</a>, <a href="/wiki/super+furry+animals">Super Furry Animals</a>, <a href="/wiki/david+devant+and+his+spirit+wife">David Devant and his Spirit Wife</a>, <a href="/wiki/belle+and+sebastian">Belle and Sebastian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/suede">Suede</a>... well vaguely realistic...
