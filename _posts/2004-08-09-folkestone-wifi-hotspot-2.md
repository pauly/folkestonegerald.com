This week's <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> would have it in their business section that the first <a href="/wiki/folkestone+wireless+hotspot">Folkestone wireless hotspot</a> has just been introduced at the <a href="/wiki/portland+hotel">Portland Hotel</a>. It's not free unfortunately, but it means you can take your wireless device (laptop, pocket pc, etc) into the hotel or the connected <a href="/wiki/skuba">Skuba</a> bar and get webbing.

It would seem not to be the first in Folkestone as the <a href="/wiki/wetherspoons">Wetherspoons</a> offered this service too, not sure if it still does though.
