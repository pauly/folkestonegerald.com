Can anyone post an update please? Pictures or details of what they have their now appreciated. Do they still have the pool table and bands? Any real ales by any chance? I doubt it. Odd sort of name, if I've got it right. Also is it only half the size now? I will have to get down to the harbour and find out...

UPDATE: I've been past it now, it looks nice but the name is <a href="/wiki/true+briton">The True Briton</a> which I do not like. No idea what it's like inside yet.
