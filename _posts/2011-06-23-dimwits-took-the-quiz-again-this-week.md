We are "the dimwits", and we took first place in the quiz at the Britannia again this week, by a healthy margin. The name is not smugly ironic or anything btw, worrying a bit that it seems like that, the quiz was named after Jim, known as Dim, who was in the team the first week. I only joined later...

Curry night next week, so I get to go for the food bit too - if they can fit us in that is. Already next Wednesday's quiz is fully booked, but they're going to try and squeeze us in. If you want to go to the quiz at the Britannia, book a couple of Wednesdays in advance...
