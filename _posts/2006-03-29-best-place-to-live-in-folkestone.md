i am thinking of moving to folkestone and am unsure of where to live. I am looking to move from manchester where for 200-250k you cant get much more than a 3 bedroom house. I am thinking in folkestone having looked on the web there is a possibility of a 5/6 bedroom house for the same money. iam unsure of which areas to look in either sandgate road (west end?) or up on the hill near the pavillion (east end?) can anyone give me any advice. I would also be interested to know if anyone has any information on proposed 50m injection of cash for redevelopment of folkestone or how much property is expected to rise when the high speed rail link is finished??
