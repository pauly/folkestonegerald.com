Celebs in the Hermitage this weekend apparently:

<blockquote>@fchb We had <a href="/wiki/timothy+west">Timothy West</a> and <a href="/wiki/prunella+scales">Prunella Scales</a> in the restaurant at the weekend. Nice people. They were at the Folkestone music festival</blockquote>

on that note, a chum at work SWEARS that his flatmate saw <a href="/wiki/gary+glitter">Gary Glitter</a> in <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a> at the weekend.
