<a href="http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/general/2008/06/10-hitatchi-hs-milestone.html">rail news has the details</a>, that's nice, but when you think about it that's not really all that impressive - the current trains could do it in not much more than that if they didn't stop at all the stations in between. Still, looking forward to it, how long can it take us to get from Folkestone to Ashford on the <a href="/wiki/high+speed+rail+link">high speed rail link</a>? Not half an hour, we'll be under that magical hour barrier to London before you know it. High paid city jobs, here we come!

What? Of course I'm a subscriber to <a href="http://www.railnews.co.uk">rail news</a>...
