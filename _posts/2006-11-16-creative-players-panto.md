Hi and hope you are well.............................
 
This is to announce the reading for The Creative Players Pantomime which will be either 'The white Cat' or 'Santa in Space'. The White Cat is a very traditional Pantomime..........Santa in Space is.................not so traditional! Both have laughs, songs, audience participation and the usual ingredients that go into the rich cake of pantomime.
 
The performance dates will be.......15th 16th and 17th of Feb 2007 With 2 performances on the saturday. So if you are skiing in Tierra Del Fuego on those dates YOU WILL MISS OUT (I've already been skiing in Tierra Del Fuego.)
 
The rehearsal nights are Tuesdays and Thursdays 7.30-10pm as usual. There will also be a few wednesdays (3 or 4) 7.30-10pm. This will all become clear at the reading.
 
WE NEED KIDS! For our excrutiatingly painfull experiments and also more importantly to be in the chorus/gangs/villigers/space aliens/frogs or whatever takes shape with the pantomime we perform.....It's great fun and they will enjoy themselves.
 
The address of the reading is Westbrook House Preparatory School,  54-56 shorncliffe rd, Folkestone, Kent. In the hall round the back of the School through the wooden gates at the side of the building.
 
We need help with all aspects of the show not just acting. There is backstage, costume, props, scenery etc.
 
So if you know anyone or you yourselves would like to participate then come along or contact me.
