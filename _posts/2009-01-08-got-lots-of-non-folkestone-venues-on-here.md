Got lots of venues in Kent, mostly venues people who might go to Folkestone might also go to, Hastings isn't so far away! This one's probably been listed because of a local band playing there. I do have lots of venues in further away places like <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/London/pub">London pubs</a>, <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/Fareham/pub">Fareham pubs</a>, and so on...
