It's valentines WHAT? That came around quick! We don't do anything for valentines, do we???

<blockquote>Welcome to Open Mic Night @ <a href="/wiki/chambers">The Chambers</a>, which this month falls on <a href="/wiki/valentines+day">Valentines Day</a>.

It is hosted upstairs in <a href="/wiki/chambers+coffee+shop">The Chambers Coffee Shop</a>. You can get a lager or the usual teas, coffee's and cakes etc or there's a full bar downstairs with a great selection of ales.

We offer a 16 track desk with full effects, good P.A, a decent monitor so you can hear yourself, a sound engineer that sits at the desk making sure you sound good (and if necessary that people listen!) and a warm atmosphere. The Coffee Shop also has excellent acoustics.

Don't worry if you're a novice or if you're nervous. Plenty of people come here to play for the very first time. We're not perfectionists! We've had many different instruments and genre of performance too.

A list is usually formed during the evening...if you wish to play at a certain time or have any special requirements please contact us on the number below...

It's a relaxed evening for ALL...we hope you enjoy it and if you do...tell your friends.

So that's this Friday 14th at 8pm
