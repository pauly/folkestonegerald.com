<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.my-kent.com/index.php/Kent-National-News/asda-folkestone-escalator-danger.html">Found this</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/richreeve1/status/1648856605">on twitter</a> a strange non story about a man preventing a DISASTER nearly caused by some people stopping at the end of the escalator? Is it an hilarious spoof? Or is it a school project website? It just gets weirder the more times I read it.
