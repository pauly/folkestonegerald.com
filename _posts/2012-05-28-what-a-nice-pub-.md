Went to <a href="/wiki/lathe+barn">Lathe Barn</a> for a birthday party on Saturday lunchtime and took the opportunity to call in to <a href="/wiki/botolphs+bridge+inn">Botolphs Bridge Inn</a> on the way back. Pub: nice, courtyard garden: nice, cider: nice, real ale: nice, other punters: nice, but most of all staff: VERY NICE! 

I wanted a beer, the boy wanted an ice cream, I hoped we could combine the two here. The kitchen was closed but one of the staff brought out some ice creams that they had personally for us to choose one. This was so nice and much appreciated!
