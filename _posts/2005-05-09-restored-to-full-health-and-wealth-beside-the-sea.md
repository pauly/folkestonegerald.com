<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">The Telegraph</a> does a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2005/05/07/pkent07.xml&sSheet=/property/2005/05/07/ixpmain12.html">feature on Folkestone property</a>... Good work! They say:

<blockquote>For several very good reasons, this town is abuzz. The Channel Tunnel is just up the road, its <a href="/wiki/high-speed+rail+link">high-speed rail link</a> to London is being extended into Folkestone's two stations in 2009 and will offer a journey time to St Pancras of just 53 minutes. But better than that, the place has its own billionaire, bent on investing in its future.</blockquote>
