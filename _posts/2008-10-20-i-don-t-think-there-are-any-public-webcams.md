None that I know of anyway. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002UZWDS/?tag=clarkeology-21">I do have one</a>, it's pointed in the house right now so not public but if I point it outwards again I will let you know.

There aren't a great number of tech-savvy businesses around here that would do that sort of thing. There aren't many public wifi spots or anything like that.
