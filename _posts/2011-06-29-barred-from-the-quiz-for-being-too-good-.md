OK, not actually barred, and nothing to do with us performing well recently, but we are not allowed to go to the quiz at <a href="/wiki/britannia">The Britannia</a> tonight; they're overbooked. It's curry night tonight, which is always very popular. We tried to book in last Wednesday but were told only we might be squeezed in. Got the call yesterday to say no, we are not squeezed in.

We will be back again next week. Good luck if you're in tonight!
