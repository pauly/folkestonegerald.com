So, with <a href="/wiki/waterstones">Waterstones</a> having taken over <a href="/wiki/ottakars">Ottakars</a>, it would seem likely at some point that one of the stores in town will close. This is not guaranteed (and I think <a href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/" title="Formerly monopolies and mergers">The Competition Commission</a> are having a look at things), but being pragmatic, it looks likely. So which branch would close?

Waterstones is huge, and looks to be a bit of a valuable location, but it doesn't seem to be as busy as Ottakars. So maybe keep Ottakars running, and cash in on the value of the premises? I hear <b>NO</b>, for the curious reason that there is a huge <b>secret bunker</b> underneath Waterstones, where all their top staff will shelter in the even of a nucular war!!!

(Or possibly that they store documents and backups and things from all the other stores, including London, there).

Nice piece in <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald+the+herald">Folkestone Herald | The Herald</a> this week about secret tunnels under Folkestone, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/folkestonegerald/sets/72057594079548411/" title="See some snaps of my visit to Down Street Station">I love stuff like this</a>, anyone got any tales about tunnelage they know about that they'd like to share? Or any more info about Waterstones / Ottakars?
