I knew there was a recruitment fair at The Leas Cliff Hall last week, but no-one told me there would be VIP guests. Apparently they asked all the other local celebs (<a href="/wiki/vic+reeves">Vic Reeves</a>, <a href="/wiki/lily+savage">Lily Savage</a>, <a href="/wiki/dot+cotton">Dot Cotton</a>, seem to have missed me) if they could come and open it, but all busy, so <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002Z3MRQ/qid=1096899397/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-8188769-7119021">The Cheeky Girls</a> did it. They live locally, and did it for free, on the condition they could play their new single <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002Z3MRQ/qid=1096899397/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-8188769-7119021">Cheeky Flamenco</a>, is this normal at a provincial job fair?
