<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1246118,00.html">Here is the article</a> from the <a href="/wiki/guardian">Guardian</a> that bigs up Folkestone, "This is an English seaside town that breathes creativity as deeply as it does the saline air that blows in from the Channel" it says here... nice one, lots about <a href="/wiki/saga">Saga</a> founder <a href="/wiki/roger+de+haan">Roger De Haan</a>'s investment, what's it doing to those <a href="/wiki/property+prices">property prices</a> then..?

A mention in that article also of the new mural at <a href="/wiki/folkestone+central+station">Folkestone Central Station</a>, saw it at the weekend, it's spooky and cool, though I forgot to take a picture. It's bronze hand casts of the people of Folkestone born in every year from 1900 to 2000. The surroundings of the bronze don't quite match up though, looks a bit like a swimming pool.
