A little feature on the regeneration. What regeneration? Sounds like this article was written a few years ago, they even have a quote from the long departed <a href="/wiki/quarter">The Quarter</a> magazine... Nice to see anyway, hope to see some more progress to live up to the hype soon.

Anyone go to the Creative Quarter open day yesterday? Couldn't make it myself :-(
