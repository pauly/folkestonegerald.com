A man <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16237088&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=man-walks-to-france-through-chunnel---in-just-his-flip-flops--name_page.html">walked through the channel tunnel in only his flip-flops</a>. FROM Folkestone, mind, he was trying to get out of the country. Also something about <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/jul2005/gb2rs_update.htm">amatuer radio broadcasts</a>, also in Folkestone. I don't really understand it, do you?
