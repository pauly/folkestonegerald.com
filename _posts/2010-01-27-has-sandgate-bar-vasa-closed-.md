I hear it's being turned into flats. Of all the pubs that might close, this one surprises me. Not that I went there, but I thought a lot of people did.

Don't even have the car this week so I can't check it out on the way home.

Any other recent pub closures please leave a message, twitter @pauly or email fg@folkestonegerald.com please.
