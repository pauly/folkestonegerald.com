ah - Thanks for taking the time to pop over to the art exhibition. tell me, did you find the venue easy enough to find? We think we may pay a visit to the Hyde Park gig soon. (Im sure you have seen the artists down there) - That'd be a very nice job through the summer months with a few jars before the last train home! Everyone: If a large painting was to be displayed in a prominent position in Folkestone, what would you like to see? . . .
