Goldie lookin chain's 'Your mother's got a penis' uses the sample from 'Behind the Mask' by Yellow Magic Orchestra! Eric Clapton covered the track. The track was originally a Yellow Magic Orchestra song written by <a href="http://www.sitesakamoto.com">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, and it's from the classic album 'Solid State Survivor'.
