I think it has been closed about 30/40 years late 70s early 80s, I did go there once many years ago and it was very much like a Beefeater before Beefeaters, I am surprised after all these years that it is in such good condition.  I cannot recall why it closed, I think it was a reasonably popular place.  Would be interested to see if there are any menus remaining, I imagine a three course meal was about 2,50, wine about 1 a bottle and beer less than 50p and the average Folkestone weekly wage about 30
