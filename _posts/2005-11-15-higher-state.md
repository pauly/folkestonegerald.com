Thanks if you just tried to add the band <a href="/wiki/higher+state">The Higher State</a> to the database, but you didn't enter venue info, or you did and I didn't recognise it. Done a bit of a search, <a href="http://www.dirtywaterclub.com">dirtywaterclub.com</a> says the band are there on the 9th of December. This is a good venue, I think I saw <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> there, not too local for me these days though. They also add:
  
<blockquote>After seven years in the wilderness, former member of the Mystreated, Marty Ratcliffe, returns with a new band! These guys give you a totally authentic, retro if you must, sixties garage band sound. These guys and a gal will have you trippin' all the way back to San Francisco's Fillmore Ballroom in late '66. A lovely West Coast, Byrdsy jangle played like you think you're truly listening to a "Back from the Grave" LP!</blockquote>
