Good Evening... I am looking to rent or purchase a pitch in your shopping centre...i am  interesting in bringing to your centre a collection of beautiful jewellery...ranging from modern,classic  traditional and beautful lines.
I appreciate your very busy at the moment but just wondered if  it would be a possibility and new year perhaps???
