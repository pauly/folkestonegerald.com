Or rather should that be "top ten places in Folkestone who have owners / staff who vote vor the venue on here"...

Googies Art Cafe (9.01/10)

Brockhill Country Park (8.77/10)

Gurkha Palace (8.56/10)

The Fountain (8.36/10)

Saltwood Castle Hotel (8.03/10)

Quarterhouse (8.03/10)

Shagor Tandoori (8.03/10)

Music Bay (7.93/10)

Home Ground (7.83/10)

Number 11 (7.69/10)

Number 11 isn't even there any more is it?

These votes come from people clicking the star ratings on the individual pub / cafe / restaurant / venue pages.
