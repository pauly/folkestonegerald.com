From <a href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk">Kent News</a>:
<blockquote>A radio controlled scale model of a German tank has been stolen from a garage in Folkestone.

The 1-16th sized half-track military vehicle from World War Two is painted in camouflage colours and has the numbers 007 in white paint on the sides and a badge on the front.

PC Andy Perham said: "This is a distinctive model, and I would like to hear from anyone who may have seen it being used or maybe being offered for sale."</blockquote>

Plenty of [ebay=remote contrrol tank]remote controlled tanks for sale here[/ebay], I don't see one that quite matches the picture on kent news though...
