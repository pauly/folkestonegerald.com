<a href="/wiki/folkestone+literary+festival+2008">Folkestone Literary Festival 2008</a> <a href="http://www.folkestonelitfest.co.uk">official site</a> has the lineup at last, in a hard to digest pdf format, <a href="http://www.folkestonelitfest.co.uk/litfest08_small.pdf">get it here</a>. All the show times, runners, riders, etc, though I wish they'd put out a text version a bit quicker instead of waiting for that to come back from the designers...
