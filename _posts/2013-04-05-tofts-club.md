Sorry, but this is not correct. The club was named TOFTS after its owner/founders Harold and Doris Toft. They were ballroom dancers who had moved to Folkestone, from Yorkshire I think. When I first heard of it in about 1961 or 1962, the club was referred to as TOFTS JAZZ CLUB. It was situated in the annexe to the old Pleasure Gardens Theatre and moved to new premises on Grace Hill in 1964 when the theatre was due to be demolished. It may have been renamed TOFFS after Harold and Doris retired and sold up and was certainly renamed TOBY'S later. I first played at the old club in 1963 on the recommendation of my friend Noel Redding and was invited to provide the house band when the new club opened the following year. My bands, The Playboys and Take 5, played around 500 nights at Tofts between 1963 and 1968.
