This is an email I was sent by Tony of the <a href="/wiki/creative+players">Creative Players</a>, who organises the <a href="/wiki/open+mic">open mic</a> nights etc at <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a>. This is his gig, not me and my wife. And it's at <a href="/wiki/googies">Googies</a>:

<blockquote>This very Friday 9pm at <a href="/wiki/googies+art+cafe">Googies Art Cafe</a> in sunny Folkestone Kent my wife and I (<a href="http://www.himnher.biz">himnher.biz</a>) will be playing a full set of our own songs (and a few covers...although not that many.)

Here's the facebook event: <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://m.facebook.com/events/279548088884453?__tn__=C">m.facebook.com/events/279548088884453?__tn__=C</a>

We would like to see as many faces, familiar or otherwise, SUPPORTING US on this one please as Keith at Googies does such a bloody good job supporting us musicians as you can see on the facebook page.
