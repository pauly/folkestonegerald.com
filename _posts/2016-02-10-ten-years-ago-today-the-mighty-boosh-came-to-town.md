There's probably more going on in Folkestone than I think, but we don't often get anything good at the main big venue the Leas Cliff Hall. That changed <a href="/wiki/ten+years+ago">ten years ago</a> this day, <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a> came to town. <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/4632/Weekend+report">I did review it at the time</a>, that's how long this website's been going, crikey. I don't have many contemporary writings of my <a href="/wiki/twenty+years+ago">twenty years ago</a> stuff that I've been rediscovering.

I think we'd not actually seen <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a> when we first bought tickets, though a friend had raved about the live show having seen them a lot at <a href="/wiki/hen+and+chickens">Hen and Chickens</a> and other places, possibly <a href="/wiki/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. I knew of <a href="/wiki/noel+fielding">Noel Fielding</a> and <a href="/wiki/julian+barratt">Julian Barratt</a> from <a href="/wiki/nathan+barley">Nathan Barley</a> though. We got the DVDs or watched the series on <a href="/wiki/bbc3">BBC3</a> or something and were converted.

Oh also <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> hass been open for <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/4275/La+Bougie+reopens+as+Escondido">over ten years</a> now.
