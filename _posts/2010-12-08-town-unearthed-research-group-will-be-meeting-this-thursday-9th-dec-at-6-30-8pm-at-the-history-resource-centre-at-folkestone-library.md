<blockquote>Dear All,

Just to remind you that the Town Unearthed Research Group will be meeting this Thursday (9th Dec) at 6.30-8pm  at the History Resource Centre at Folkestone Library.

We will be discussing research themes and agreeing groups and questions.

Also, on the following Thursday (16th) the Research group will be holding a Magic Lantern Show of slides from the Winbolt excavation of the villa hosted for us by 'Professor Coulson and his Magic Lantern' ( 6.30-8pm).

This will be preceded by a 'Victorian Christmas' event at the HRC with some  festive refreshments and a chance to look at some Victorian items from the Library's collection (5 -6.30pm) All are welcome.

I will be sending out more details later.
