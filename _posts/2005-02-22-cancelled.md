Looks like <a href="/wiki/goldie+lookin+chain">Goldie Lookin' Chain</a> have cancelled tonight at the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a>, when did this happen? Is it apathy on the part of the punters, or is it (as I heard) that the band refused to play because of the reaction they got when they supported <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> just over a year ago..?

The band have <a href="http://www.youknowsit.co.uk/lowtech/gigs.htm">also cancelled their Irish shows</a>, don't know if this is related... The Irish contingent at the Darkness show where the only ones being supportive of the 'Chain!

Hmm, they've even wiped the scheduled Folkestone show from the history books, guess it was cancelled a long while back.
