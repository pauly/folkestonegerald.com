We're off to <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> next week. First time I've said this in a good dozen years I'm sure! It's at the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a>, and I'm sure it'll be great.

When it comes to the actual day though, and we actually have to leave the house, will we actually do it?
