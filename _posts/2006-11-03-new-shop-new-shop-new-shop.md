It's all very well these nice new shops like <a href="/wiki/mini+mooch">Mini Mooch</a> opening in Folkestone, but to be honest, that <a href="/wiki/old+high+street">Old High Street</a> is a bit too far away when you live in the opulent West End, like what I do. So it's great to see a new shop called [google=farago folkestone]Farago[/google], opening on <a href="/wiki/bouverie+road+west">Bouverie Road West</a>, where the off license was, next to <a href="/wiki/shanel+s+brasserie">Shanel's Brasserie</a>. It will be selling retro things and collectable books, according to the swanky new window display, and I'm guessing it will be open any day now. It's a shame that that section of <a href="/wiki/bouverie+road+west+brw">Bouverie Road West | BRW</a> is CURSED, and it will struggle...
There's another new lpace offering "home fashions" just opposite <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a>, is this the fabled knock on effect of the regeneration of other areas already? Town is looking nicer these days I feel.
