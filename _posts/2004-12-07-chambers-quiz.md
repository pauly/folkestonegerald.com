What was that all about then? There was no quiz at <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> in December, as they're saving it up for Christmas Day... I guess this means no quiz in January either, when on earth are we meant to defend our title?

Advertising of events has been a bit on the slow side, there's no sign of posters regarding <a href="/wiki/new+years+eve">New Years Eve</a> yet, but we hear it will be an indie disco, five pounds a ticket...

Ads up in Chambers on the chalk boards saying "for listings see <a href="http://www.thegigguide.info">thegigguide.info</a>"... seems to be a new effort, not a lot of info on it so far, no mention of Chambers being shut on the 10th of December (it is, private party I guess) or of what's going on New Years Eve... don't see the point in setting up another site for this sort of stuff (though I did it myself), though it could be a school project. Looks to be all local band type stuff and <a href="http://www.mrgig.com/gigs">Mr Gig does this very well</a>... I hope <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">folkestonegerald.com</a> won't get shunted down the search engine listings by this, unlikely, though by me linking to them I'm helping them out!
