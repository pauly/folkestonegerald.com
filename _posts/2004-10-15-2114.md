Yeh been to good few (gets ticket stub collection)-reef, motorhead, polyphonic spree, the darkness, turin brakes, spiritualized, local band nite featurin APV, the bluetones. not in any particular order. is well close to me cos i only live in cheriton! 
Lookin back over the gigs that av been there though i wish i was born in late 50's or sumfin, would be a dream to av seen thin lizzy, sabbath,aswel as all the other quality bands about years ago. those two in particular though i love em now. u seen many gigs there?
