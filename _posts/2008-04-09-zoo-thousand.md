This music festival crept up on me <a href="/wiki/cribs">The Cribs</a>, <a href="/wiki/athlete">Athlete</a>, <a href="/wiki/funeral+for+a+friend">Funeral For A Friend</a> and loads more (fairly small) bands are playing at <a href="/wiki/port+lympne">Port Lympne</a> this August. Can you get me free tickets?

Hmm <a href="/wiki/mark+ronson">Mark Ronson</a> is on the <a href="http://www.zoothousand.com/zoo-thousand-festival-line-up.cfm">line up page</a> but not on <a href="http://www.zoothousand.com/">the homepage</a> does that mean he's just been added or just been removed?
