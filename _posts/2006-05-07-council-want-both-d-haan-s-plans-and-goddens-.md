I hear Shepway council want both D'Haan's plans AND Goddens to go forward - even though D'Haan has made it quite clear that his plans require the ground rent on the flats on Godden's land to support the marina... AND despire the fact that Godden's plans are feck awful! Apparently it's in the Folkestone Herald this week - could you see what it says my friend? thanks!
