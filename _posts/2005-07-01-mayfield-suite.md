Anyone know where / what the "Mayfield Suite" was? It's a venue of some kind, <a href="/wiki/gene+loves+jezebel">Gene Loves Jezebel</a> played there once... what is it known as now?

And while I'm about it, what is "The Elizabethan"? It's on <a href="/wiki/sandgate+road">Sandgate Road</a> and looks like it's been shut forever...
