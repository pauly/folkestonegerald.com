A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cherryvega/sets/113138">photoshoot, photoshot in Folkestone</a>. At the Rotunda. Not sure about that bloody great cleaver...

Found this while trying out this <a href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/flickr_postcard_browser/app/">Postcard browser</a> that someone's written, really it's just searching <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/folkestone/">Flickr for Folkestone</a>.
