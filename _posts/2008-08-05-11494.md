I used to work at The Jackdaw, the people who run it are nasty and the food is even worse. The cleanliness standard in the kitchen are horrendous and way the food is prepared is stored is no better. If food is sent back due to a fault in the kitchen or the customer changing their mind the waitress staff get the blame. The work atmosphere is very strained and nervous. Everybody is working to very high standards (which is no bad thing) but if the simplest of mistakes are made the bosses react very angrily and shout which leads to a very uneasy work environment where all staff are unhappy. I left working there in July last year and in September I was still phoning asking where the rest of my owed tip money was. I never recieved it and never had a reply as to why I recieved no money for the very long, hard hours I worked with no break. I strongly advised everyone thinking of going to eat there not to go! 20 mins down the road as you enter Canterbury there is a lovely pub called The Gate Inn, it's cheaper and food is nicer. 

I know this sounds like a bad review as I got stiffed on my tips but I'm not the only person who has had no tips for working very hard there.
