Visited Little Switzerland as we were told there was a fantastic view.We were not disappointed.Wasn't staying at the camping and caravanning site but if ever I needed that facility it would be the ideal location, beautiful views,clean and quiet. It has the added bonus of a very nice cafe/bar with seating looking out over the English Channel and you can even see France.The owners and their staff are very welcoming and friendly. There is a good selection of food which was very reasonable and served quickly. Alot of people were just having tea and cakes which also looked very good. I would highly recommend a visit here to eat and take in the view, even if you are not camping.
