I honestly don't think anyone who looked at it would have regarded it in any way.  They would have probably ignored it.  It's a public journal, but still personal to me.  I agree with Dean, I don't know if you saw his comment  - 

"This isn't fair, I read Doz's Blog regularly and you've completely taken this out of context, and apparently without her permission. Even if journals are public on the internet they are still personal. This isn't a report on the ice rink, it's a personal opinion of it. Furthermore it was made on the spur of the moment, like much in journal entry, it reflects the feelings of the person at the time. Therefore you can hardly call this little snippet relevant in my opinion. I also seriously doubt that this would have had an effect on anyone working on local projects. Chances are they would never have come across it or simply disregarded it as after all, it's just a journal entry of one person, not an opinion widely shared among your community. By displaying it in this way you're giving people the wrong idea about the author and the Ice Rink itself."
