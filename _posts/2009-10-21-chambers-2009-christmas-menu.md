This came through to work - by FAX! How retro!

<blockquote>Chicken liver, garlic and herb pate with red currants and grilled bread flutes
Roasted parsnip and honey soup finished with almond cappucion and rosemary infusion
Lemon cous cous and fine herb stuffed baby squid with a tomato, cucumber passata and endive salad
~~~
Traditional Chambers roast turkey served with all the trimmings
Braised steak cooked in real ale with caramelised shallots and bacon lardons
Roasted grey mullet fillet with pea and pumpkin risotto, anchovy dressing and shaved parmesan
Spinach, ricotta and parsnip tartlet with walnut crumble, baked pear and prune puree
~~~
Christmas pudding and brandy sauce
Lemon posset with a red currant and blackberry jelly
Wensleydale and cranberry cheesecake with a butter crunch biscuit and apricot coulis</blockquote>

Two courses for 13.95 or 3 courses for 18.95.

Nothing for me (although I do have a grey mullet), I will try and get in there for a beer soon though.
