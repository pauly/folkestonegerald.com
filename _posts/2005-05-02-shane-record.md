Local artist <a href="http://www.shanerecord.com">Shane Record</a> (whose paintings we quite like) has launched a rival to <a href="/wiki/quarter">The Quarter</a>, a spoof publication called <a href="/wiki/other+three+quarters">The Other Three Quarters</a>, because they've been critical of him, hmm... got some raffle tickets anyway, hoping to win the chance to commission his 100th Folkestone painting.
