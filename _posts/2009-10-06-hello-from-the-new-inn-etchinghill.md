<blockquote>There's so much happening between now and the end of the year that we decided to keep this newsletter short & sweet. We hope you can join us!

    * Halloween Party when the pub will be spookily decorated from top to bottom.
    * 1970's Retro Night in aid of Lyminge pre-school.
    * Black Tie Dinner for a chance to dress-up to the nines.
    * The Festive Season is selling fast - book your celebration now.
    * New Year's Eve Party has only two tables left and looks like being the highlight of the year.
    * Valentine's Day is already selling fast - don't miss out.

And of course, at any time of year, we offer delicious Sunday Roast, free wi-fi, fine cuisine, and traditional cask ales.
