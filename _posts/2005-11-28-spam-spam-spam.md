Wow what a coincidence that you all have the same positive points to make! Do you work for <a href="/wiki/m+b+builders+ltd">M&B Builders Ltd</a>, are they desperate for some positive press? There's no need for deviousness here, a few biased comments are fine, someone else will come along and balance them up - just look at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/folkestone/10/35/">The Timothy Swinebar saga</a>.

If you're connected in some way with the development, why not post up a few pictures, really try and sell the places? I'm as keen for the regeneration of Folkestone as anyone.

I've got it, why not do an Evening Standard style apartment giveaway, in return for acres of press?
