Yeah, I've seen the Wayne McConnell Quartet too, and they're alright I ssuppose, if you like that sort of thing.  What they need though is a bit of show biz razz-a-ma-tazz, some sparkley suits and frilly cuffed shirts, some backing singers and a 6 piece horn section, a bit of a light show and a troupe of dancing chimps, maybe a bubble machine, some dry ice  and few white tigers, a singer or two and more songs, some motown numbers would go down well, oh yeah, and a spectacular finish with the sax player tied up in chains, placed in a sack and hoisted up above the stage on a burning rope, and hope he gets out before h crashes down on the drummer.  Then they would be worth seeing.
