Had a rare night out on Saturday, babysitter in, pregnant wife able to drive us anywhere so we went a bit further afield to some pubs we'd not tried before. First stop <a href="/wiki/black+horse">The Black Horse</a> <a href="/wiki/monks+horton">Monks Horton</a>. And it's great! I knew this pub would be, it's just a little out of the way, but worth a visit. Huge, big garden, TV outside (though not on when we were there). <a href="/wiki/real+ale">Real ale</a> was good, and they have a <a href="/wiki/bar+billiards">bar billiards</a> table, which we played.

Food sounds good, we will be back to visit another time. They had a <a href="/wiki/giant+puffball">giant puffball</a> on display that had been foraged locally, and was due to be cooked up the following day (so Sunday, yesterday). Let me know if you ate it!
