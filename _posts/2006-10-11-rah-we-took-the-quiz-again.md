The quiz at the ship is GREAT, surprise question master this week was the wife's cousin, but I SWEAR this is not how we won. It all came down to a tie breaker in the end, set by the landlord (who is not a relation) on how much the bus fare was from <a href="/wiki/barcelona">Barcelona</a> airport to the town...

It's a friendly quiz, but I'm not sure how friendly it's going to stay if we win again next week. Might have to put more effort into a funny team name and less into the questions, as some of the players there seem to do. Man, they do not like <a href="/wiki/dolphin+dave+the+dolphin">dolphin | Dave the Dolphin</a> for some reason...
