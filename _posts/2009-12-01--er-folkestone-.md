<a href="http://www.3am.co.uk/small-fishing-town-in-scotland-wins-alexandra-burke-shall-we-let-them-keep-her-/20068/">what's that meant to mean daily mirror</a>? If I find out it's someone I know who wrote that I will be doubly offended! <a href="http://www.3am.co.uk/small-fishing-town-in-scotland-wins-alexandra-burke-shall-we-let-them-keep-her-/20068/">Some nonsense about x-factor</a> and how someone is doing a PA in Aberdeen rather than Folkestone.
