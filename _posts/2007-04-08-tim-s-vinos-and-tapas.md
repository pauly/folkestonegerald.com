I've only been to Tim's twice, the first time was just to have a quick glass of wine and see what the place was like - I left about 4 hours later, as relaxed as a newt, vowing that the next time I was in Folkestone I'd actually book a table!  About 3 months later (Mar 07) I did as I promised.  My friend and I turned up at 7.30 and the place was fairly quiet - bonus for us as we ordered before the rush, and what a rush!  By 8.30 the place was packed, the atmosphere was superb, the wine free-flowing (and very nice) but the food surpassed it all!  We had a sea food paella and it was totally delicious!
