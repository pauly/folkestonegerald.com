<blockquote><a href="/wiki/cheriton+lights+festival">Cheriton Lights Festival</a>: Sunday Lantern parade

24 February 2013

Following the spectacular light based artwork installations on 23rd February, the chilly night air of sunday 24th february will be charged by with a second night of excitement. This time there will be fire and drums to set the heart racing. The Cheriton Light Festival will be a time of beauty, dark skies, burning phoenix, exploding pyrotechnics and the exhilarating gathering of a whole community to celebrate together.

From 5.15pm a procession of over 300 candle lit paper pyramids and beautiful sculptural lanterns created by local young people in workshops will set off, reclaiming the streets of Cheriton for the night for people. serenaded by the amazing rhythms of international drumming bands Batala and Bloco Fogo, who will be pounding out their crazy rhythms to carry the parade from <a href="/wiki/st+georges+road">St Georges Road</a>, along <a href="/wiki/cheriton+high+street">Cheriton High Street</a> to <a href="/wiki/stanley+road">Stanley Road</a> and the finale in Cheriton Recreation Ground. The audience will be treated to the most spectacular finale, and those who will have braved the chill night are in for a magical sight of a giant sculptural bonfire in the form of a Phoenix, built in the grounds of the park - awaiting to be burned amidst a cacophony of drums and fireworks. Be there!! The event has been supported by Arts Council England, Roger De Haan Charitable Trust, Paul Hamlyn Foundation, Interreg European Funding, Shepway District Council and Kent County Council. The Cheriton Lights Festival was selected under the European cross-border cooperation programme INTERREG IV A France (Channel) - England, co-funded by the ERDF
