From <a href="http://www.mrgig.com/discusstopic/7471/1">today's discussion on mrgig.com</a>:

PuddingMushroom says "I think they played the Penny Theatre", Mikos says "they definitely played the Penny", and then we're diverted into other bands that played (<a href="/wiki/cranberries">The Cranberries</a> and <a href="/wiki/reef">Reef</a> (twice) <a href="/wiki/ash">Ash</a>, <a href="/wiki/skunk+anansie">Skunk Anansie</a>, <a href="/wiki/soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, <a href="/wiki/therapy+">Therapy?</a> and <a href="/wiki/babylon+zoo">Babylon Zoo</a>)  before Oozye contributes: "yeah it true i played at penny theatre the week after RADIOHEAD" so that's good enough for me...

UPDATE: And <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/folkestone/42/70/">a final official confirmation here</a>. Cheers!
