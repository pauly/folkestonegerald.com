<blockquote>This Thursday, we will be looking at Natural Wines, a movement that started approximately 10 to 15 years ago. The premise is simple - if the producer works so hard in the vineyard to produce grapes without any chemical intervention, then they should follow a similar purist course of action in the winery. Too many restaurant wine lists offer no alternative to the reams of highly manufactured wines while supermarkets will never stock a wine that they cannot absolutely guarantee. 

So, for something different and exciting, come along to this evening and experience the remarkable taste of these 'real' wines - afterall, the truest representation of terroir can only be achieved with the minimum of interventions.
