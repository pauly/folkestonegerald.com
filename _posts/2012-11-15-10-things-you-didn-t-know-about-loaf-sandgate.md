It's nice, though they've got rid of all of the children's toys... It's going for a more adult sophisticated air I think, the menu is very short but looks delicious. I hope they can make a go of it.

You still have to go through the bike workshop to an outside toilet though, that is surely going to put people off...

UPDATE: no that's not actually 10 things is it, just trying something.
