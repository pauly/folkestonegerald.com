Stumbled across this page during a fit of nostalgia! You are right it was rescheduled, apparently due to the singer having a sore throat. However! It was 22nd March 1992 (or rather the following Sunday), rather than 1994. Brilliant gig, even though my mum made me take a kagool (I was 15). Support band was Boneyard. Whatever happened to them? Brilliant venue- someone restore it!
