I took a party of six to the newly opened 66 recently on Sandgate high Street and we all enjoyed ourselves hugely. Parking was no problem as there is a Shepway park within easy walking distance.The premises has been completely refurbished from top to bottom and it shows.I was surprised by the inventiveness of the menu.and the effort that must have gone in  to it. The steak had been imported from Argentina and was the best that I had ever tasted. The wine list was choice. There is a new brick,wood fired pizza oven which will be nice on cold winter days. I understand that Jo, the proprietor attended a catering college at Canterbury on leaving  school and has worked in several top eateries in the UK and abroad, including the Cafe Royal in London and locally the Five B ells in Brabourne, a noted eating house on the Pilgrims  Way.If there were any teething troubles on opening  they appeared to have been sorted as I found the staff  to be helpful and polite.Shepway council staff made a 2 hour inspection recently and awarded 5 stars which is top rating.Good luck to Jo.  Why not try it for yourselves
