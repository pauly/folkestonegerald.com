Is that an "under offer" sign I spied in <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a>'s window? And why haven't they cleared out the tables and chairs or the bar yet? Is there a chance of it reopening as a bar?

And what's the latest on <a href="/wiki/leas+club">The Leas Club</a>, is it closing down or what?
