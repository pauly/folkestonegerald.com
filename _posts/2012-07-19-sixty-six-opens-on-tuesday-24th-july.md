New restaurant in Sandgate, though this flyer I have makes it sound a bit more like a kebab shop than I was expecting. Restaurant and takeaway, char grilled Argentina Beef and Lamb (or is that Argentinian?) and an Italian pizza oven.

The website link they put on their flyers doesn't go anywhere...
