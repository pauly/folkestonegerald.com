Went to <a href="/wiki/pullman">The Pullman</a> at the weekend and we were amazed at how nice it is now. I didn't go there much before it closed down, but this refurb is a great job. They do food and four real ales now, and there's a nice atmosphere. It's aimed at a more sophisticated older crowd now I would say than your average binge drinkers, maybe that's why it was a bit quiet. Seriously, give it a try.
