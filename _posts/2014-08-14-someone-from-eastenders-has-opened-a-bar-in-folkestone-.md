I never get out any more, I heard this from the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> today! <a href="/wiki/stuart+antony">Stuart Antony</a> who was <a href="/wiki/simon+from+eastenders">Simon from Eastenders</a> (no me neither, was he Bianca's brother? I don't recognise the face, are you sure you were in <a href="/wiki/eastenders">Eastenders</a> mate?) is opening the bar in <a href="/wiki/rendezvous+street">Rendezvous Street</a> that you might know as <a href="/wiki/rockanrolla">Rockanrolla</a>. Unlikely you would know it as that, because I don't think it was open very long. Previously it was <a href="/wiki/stones">Stones</a>, <a href="/wiki/mango">Mango</a>, um, <a href="/wiki/scruffy+murphy">Scruffy Murphy</a>? something like that. Good luck to him anyway, it's going to be a mostly <a href="/wiki/gay">gay</a> bar called <a href="/wiki/bar+24">Bar 24</a>.

<blockquote>I'm trying to get a bit of London down here, a Soho vibe. We are hoping to attract a <a href="/wiki/lgbt">LGBT</a> crowd</blockquote>

What's <a href="/wiki/lgbt">LGBT</a> it's a type of sandwich isn't it? 

Always exciting that there is a bar opening, rather than a bar closing, even if it's probably not my sort of place.

Looks like <a href="/wiki/simon+from+eastenders">Simon from Eastenders</a> as he styles himself <a href="http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/10464949.Ex_EastEnders_star_takes_over_Bexleyheath_pub_after_brush_with_death/">previously had a pub</a> in <a href="/wiki/bexleyheath">Bexleyheath</a>, and <a href="http://www.dover-kent.com/Chequers-Ash.html">another in Ash, in Kent</a> where injured himself badly when a window fell on him. <a href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/former_eastenders_actor_toasts_new_career_as_landlord_of_rochester_pub_1_1366739">He was landlord</a> of <a href="/wiki/granville+arms">The Granville Arms</a> in <a href="/wiki/rochester">Rochester</a> too, probably more to be found, these landlords do move about.

At two of those previous pubs he has said that "a few of the <a href="/wiki/eastenders">Eastenders</a> lot want to come down" I've not seen that claim made about <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> yet though, and I'm not confident that he was actually an "eastenders star" I can find no mention of him or his character online apart from in his own [google=stuart antony eastenders]ex eastenders actor now works in pub[/google] stories. Are you actually an <a href="/wiki/extra">extra</a> / <a href="/wiki/background+artiste">background artiste</a> Simon from Eastenders?

Don't be mixing up <a href="/wiki/bar+24">Bar 24</a> with <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a>, ah they were some happy days weren't they?

I'm out in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> on Saturday night, I think I will check it out! It has <a href="/wiki/pole+dancing">pole dancing</a>. Hey yeah there are gay Polish people too.

I think I'll be doing that <a href="/wiki/lgbt">LGBT</a> joke a few more times.
