Pauly, thank you so very much for your great kindness in locating this old college building and for taking the photos for me.

Would you please happen to know what sort of college it was?

The girl who attended there (whose family history I've been following) died at age 19, not long after leaving the college. Her father was a Baptist Minister and I thought it may have been some sort of religious college.  This would also tie in with it having sometimes been called "Fellenberg House Seminary".

Thank you once again for your help and kindness.

Regards, Ruth
