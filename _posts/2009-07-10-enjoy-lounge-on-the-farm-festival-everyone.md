Sounds like it will be great. One member of our baby club is going, bah her kid is off to a better gig headstart already than ours. Still a bit early for us I think.

Don't forget <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/gig/Folkestone-Festival-Folkestone-Festival-site/120387.html">Folkestone's own Hevy festival</a> on the 1st of August, right after pay day!
