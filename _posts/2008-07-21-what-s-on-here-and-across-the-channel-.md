Well someone just emailed to suggest picking up a copy of "Coast To Coast" magazine (does it have <a href="/wiki/fred+dinenage">Fred Dinenage</a> and <a href="/wiki/fern+britten">Fern Britten</a> on the cover?) but you can also see what's going on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">the homepage of the Gerald</a>...

<blockquote>MORE than sixty summer festivals and events are listed in the latest edition of Coast to Coast, the  seasonal guide published jointly by the Discover Folkestone, Hythe and Romney Marsh tourism partnership and its across-Channel counterpart, Le Boulonnais.  

   Twenty thousand copies - 10,000 in English and the same number in French - have been produced  for distribution on both sides of the Channel.  

   The guide is one of a number of initiatives by the Anglo-French public and commercial  sector partnership to boost tourism to, in and between destinations in the 'Channel region'. 

   The project, part-funded by the EU, was co-ordinated by the Boulogne Shepway Co- operation Organisation (BOSCO) whose members include Shepway District Council and local  authorities in and around Boulogne.      

   Discover Folkestone manager Chris Kirkham said that the guide aimed to encourage  residents and visitors on both coasts to discover the great variety of attractions, festivals  and events on offer at resorts on the opposite side of the Channel. 

   The guide can be picked up locally from Shepway District Council and Folkestone Town Council offices, Discover  Folkestone information points, public libraries and some shops and hotels. </blockquote>
