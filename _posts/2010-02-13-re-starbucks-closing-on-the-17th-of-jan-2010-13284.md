Clearly not as I went there today and they are still there. You should stop running Folkestone down. It isn't marvellous and looks like it's dying but it is better than Dover except for the lack of a Marks and Spencer and I would die for a Primark near me. 

Starbucks aren't good but the cafe was very busy today
