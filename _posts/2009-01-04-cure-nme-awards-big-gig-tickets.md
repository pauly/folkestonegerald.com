Not Folkestone, not even that local, but a fairly easy journey from Folkestone to the <a href="/wiki/o2+arena">O2 Arena</a>, one we're making, I'd hate for you to miss out too. It's <a href="/wiki/cure">The Cure</a>, and they're headlining the <a href="http://www.getmein.com/tickets/nme-awards-big-gig-tickets/london-105288.html">NME poll winners party</a> type thing. Officially sold out, but you can still <a href="http://www.getmein.com/tickets/nme-awards-big-gig-tickets/london-105288.html">get tickets here</a> at not a bad price at all, standing around the <a href="http://www.getmein.com/tickets/nme-awards-big-gig-tickets/london-105288.html">53 quid</a> mark, seating in all areas cheaper. [ebay=cure tickets]Similar deals on ebay too[/ebay].

Support possibly from <a href="/wiki/white+lies">White Lies</a> and <a href="/wiki/crystal+castles">Crystal Castles</a>, though the rumours do keep changing, there are more to be announced. I'm keeping an eye on <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/825751">this event page</a> on <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, though I guess <a href="http://nme.com">nme.com</a> ought to know what's going on...

Also there are <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/tickets/nme">tickets for the NME Awards tour</a>, what used to be the <a href="/wiki/brat+bus">Brat Bus</a> in my day...
