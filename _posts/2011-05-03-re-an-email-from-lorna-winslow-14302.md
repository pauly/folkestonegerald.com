<blockquote>Hi Trevour
Nice to hear back from you and yes I am very well and still have a pulse, thank you!
Were we all in the same graphics group?  think you might be in an old picture of our group that Sue sent to me the other day, (don't know how I could forward it to you on this site though). I am married with 2 beautiful girls, one 24 and the other nearly 22. My husband and myself did have a design company for many years but don't do much now, I feel rather fed up with graphics, did start to do sculpture and body casting which I love but its quite messy and difficult to do without having a workshop at the moment.
Still very skinny, love fashion but have lost the hendrix look. Say hello to John Lucas if you are in contact with him.
All the best. Lorna</blockquote>
