<a href="/wiki/leas+club">The Leas Club</a> is meant to be closing at some point, it's to be redeveloped as flats and maybe a gym?
<a href="/wiki/jolsons">Jolsons</a> is a sort of a club bar, is it called the Party Bar now? Is it even still open? I haven't been there for years either!
<a href="/wiki/wetherspoons">Wetherspoons</a> is still the same, a big pub like all wetherspoons.
<a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> is the place to go I think, it's a mix of old style pub and nice bar and restaurant and all sorts, something for everyone.
Went in <a href="/wiki/view">The View</a> at the weekend (top of Rememberance Hill), that seemed to be good again, not so full of the wrong sort as it was when I went previously. Might have been just to do with the music event going on.
<a href="/wiki/guildhall">The Guildhall</a> and <a href="/wiki/british+lion">The British Lion</a> are also nice traditional boozers and there are some down at the Harbour too. Not keen on <a href="/wiki/harbour">The Harbour</a> itself, they can all be a bit iffy round there at times...

Let me know how you get on!
