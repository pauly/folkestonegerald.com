Some pictures I've just been sent, of <a href="/wiki/pretty+things">The Pretty Things</a> when they played at <a href="/wiki/micks+flamenco+bar">Micks' Flamenco Bar</a> (now better known as <a href="/wiki/pipers">Pipers</a>) in [year]1967[/year]:

<blockquote>That last photo was taken outside George Robey's the tobacconist a couple of doors down from the club.
The next two were taken inside the club. I am not sure about the year, but probably [year=1966]66[/year] or [year=1967]67[/year]. If I could find out when Skip took over as drummer from Viv Prince, it might help.</blockquote>

That's from the supplier of the photos, <a href="http://www.answers.com">answers.com</a> says

<blockquote>His increasing unreliability came to a head on a legendary summer [year]1965[/year] tour of New Zealand, culminating in his getting thrown off the plane returning the group to England shortly before takeoff. Whatever his exact behavior during the tour, he did his share or more for earning the group a lifetime ban from the country. (It's also been reported that he was the first British rock star busted for drug possession, though details are elusive.) He continued to play with the group, and exasperate them with some missed gigs and unruly conduct, before he left for good in November [year]1965[/year]. </blockquote>
