The Frenchman has a WII console! Brilliant, played this afternoon. I am quite new to this modern technology, but we had a few good games of bowling and tennis, for free, at the pleasure of the landlord. More pubs should do this.

I urge you to head to The Frenchman at your earliest convenience. It's going to work better at off peak times, like Sunday afternoon I suspect.
