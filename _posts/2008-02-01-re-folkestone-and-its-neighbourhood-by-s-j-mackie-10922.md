hI,
i READ YOUR MESSAGE ABOUT GETTING "EASY" GETTING A COPY OF "mackie". i'M ONLY INTERESTED IN pAGE 152 REF "coldham".

Did you obtain it, and if so, could you guide me as to how i could obtain a copy, ideally at a low price.

With many thanks

==========================================================

One resource that seems invaluable in Folkestone history terms would seem to be A Descriptive and Historical Account of Folkestone and Its Neighbourhood, with Gleanings from the Municipal Records, quite a mouth full, usually referred to as just Mackie (or Folkestone and its neighbourhood. That has a mention of The Radnor Club, on page 97, this index to it says so...

I've found this research quite fascinating, I didn't realise how easy it would be to get a copy of the long out of print Mackie, I'm getting one.
