So something new opening in Folkestone, that's positive then! Do we need more places for coffee though? I'd like more choice for places to sit down and eat, but realistically I suppose we need places we can go in the day with the baby, you can knock the big chains but <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> is always reliable for that... hope the coffee is good in this new place!
