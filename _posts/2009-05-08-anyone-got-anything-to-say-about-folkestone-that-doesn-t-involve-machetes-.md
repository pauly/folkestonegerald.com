Lordy all these tweeting and retweeting, see what the front page of <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com the Gerald]]" title="Romney Marsh Times">looks like at the moment! [[http://twitter.com/rmtimes @rmtimes</a> seems to have broken the story and we've all passed it on, and every time someone else passed it on I've retweeted them because they mentioned Folkestone. It's not even like the machete attack was in Folkestone, the chaps were just arrested here, it happened in <a href="/wiki/peterborough">Peterborough</a>!

Can't we talk about something cheerier? What else is going on? I'm going to a boot fair on Shorncliffe Road in the morning, do come along and <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/m/12586/Not+got+as+many+CD+s+as+I+thought">buy all my CD's</a>. Well buy what's left, sold about 80 today at work, so there's only about A THOUSAND left...
