(and the wife says "I've been here nearly twenty years")

I thought <a href="/wiki/sandwich">Sandwich</a> was nice from brief visits, but when I saw it on that <a href="/wiki/wild+food">wild food</a> programme, I'd never seen somewhere I've wanted to visit less. And I've been to <a href="/wiki/blackpool">Blackpool</a>. Are you from there?
