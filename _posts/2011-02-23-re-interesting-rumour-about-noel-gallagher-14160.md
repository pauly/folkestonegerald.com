I think thats a block of flats by the Clarendon called seagull court or something,i wouldnt want to live there it seems to be made of chipboard and plastic,much like the derelict one by the flower shop in Cheriton Rd.I think the Noel Gallagher thing stems from the Manchester architect whose designed a big house somewhere down there.Riviera way maybe.Wouldnt want to be a neighbour esp if his brother visits !
