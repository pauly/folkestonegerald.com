Just came across your mention of The Higher State. I saw them on 9th December at the Dirty Water Club and they were really very good. It's seldom that I see a first band on get such a reception from an audience that mostly doesn't know already, even asking them for an encore. They're back at the Dirty Water Club on 14 April (with an Australian all girl group called The Dollsquad and a spanish garage band called The Hollywood Sinners).
