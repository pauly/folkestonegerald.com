A few years ago Folkestone was on its uppers, with boarded-up buildings and run-down "dole-on-sea" rental lets. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2005/09/17/pboat17.xml&sSheet=/property/2005/09/17/ixpmain12.html">But it was on the cusp of rebirth</a>, according to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">telegraph.co.uk</a>. Not much new there really.
