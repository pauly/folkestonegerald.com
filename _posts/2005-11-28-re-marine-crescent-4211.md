Marine crescent Folkestone Restoration project
There is alot of comments about how small the flats are, but i personally think that they are definately an investment not to be missed.
The builders involved M&B ltd Builders ltd deserve a medal for taking the project on, and all the contractors have worked really hard on the restoration of Marine Crescent,after viewing the showflat and having a tour, its amazing to see the difference, from the run down derilict forgotten property it was.
This should be one restoration Folkestone will defentely be thankfull of.
Georgous piece of history restored to its beauty.
Well done .
