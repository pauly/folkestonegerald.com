Friday 16th November

Doors at 7:00pm 

After a long hiatus, <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>s <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a> will be hosting a local music night on Friday 16th November, but this time its different. The event, <a href="/wiki/local+heroes">Local Heroes</a>, will bring together Kents greatest bands for a unique line-up of <a href="/wiki/folk">folk</a>, <a href="/wiki/funk">funk</a>, <a href="/wiki/punk">punk</a>, <a href="/wiki/ska">ska</a>, and <a href="/wiki/rock">rock</a>. This will be the first event promoted by <a href="/wiki/hevy">Hevy</a>, a newly formed company established by <a href="/wiki/james+dutton">James Dutton</a>, part-time marketing employee of the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a>. James aspires to deliver large scale events that showcase the talent produced by the area, allowing local acts to experience a bigger stage without leaving Kent for <a href="/wiki/london">London</a>. 

The line-up, which delivers an overview of Kents varied music scene, includes four of the areas best bands with four sensational acoustic supports. The headlining acts are kick-started by <a href="/wiki/syd+arthur">Syd Arthur</a>; an awesomely talented band from <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> whose style is best described as psychedelic funk rock. Hailed as the true heirs to the Canterbury sound, their infectious riffs and fusion of influences from just about every genre make <a href="/wiki/syd+arthur">Syd Arthur</a> one of the most exciting bands Kent has seen for years. 

Next up are <a href="/wiki/springtide+cavalry">Springtide Cavalry</a>, who have forged their own unique sound somewhere between rock, pop and punk and are just as comfortable chilling with slow mesmeric grooves as they are blitzing the crowd with all out rock and roll. The trio from the <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> / <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> area have earned a huge following and are definitely one to watch. <a href="/wiki/weightloss">Weightloss</a> are a legendary ska/punk band with technical horn parts and impatient rhythms that empower the socially angry lyrics that vocalist Dan spits out with true meaning and experience. The band, half of which is from Hertfordshire, combines influences from hardcore, ska, punk, and funk, creating dark sounding songs that focus on the social issues that concern them. 

Last on stage are alternative rock band <a href="/wiki/sizen">Sizen</a>, who deliver a solid, raw sound with interesting licks cutting through unbelievably heavy riffs. Inspired by the greatest rock bands of all time, <a href="/wiki/sizen">Sizen</a> have defined their own sound whilst honoring the musicians that influenced them. Supporting these bands are four acts that represent the cream of kentish talent. Acoustic sessions will be performed by <a href="/wiki/rob+john+gambell">Rob John Gambell</a> - an extraordinary artist and effortless performer, <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> legend <a href="/wiki/jon+woode">Jon Woode</a> - whose technical ability and song-writing flare define his folk and indie inspired acoustic music, <a href="/wiki/amber+room">Amber Room</a> - a former duet who have now evolved into one of the most unique and talented bands in Kent, and <a href="/wiki/lucy+kitt">Lucy Kitt</a> - a truly gifted singer songwriter, attracting attention for her individual and exciting fresh new sound.
