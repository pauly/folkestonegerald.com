Saturday 15 Augusr 2009, I stopped in at the George for a bite to eat with my wife and 7 month old baby. Was advised restaurant not open untiol 6 . . .no problem. Sat down to enjoy some real ale. Pub was very busy, with only 1 poor chap runing the place, name of Callum. He said he would come over and take our food order as soon as his shift helper started at 6. The guy who was due to start at 6 had been sitting at the end iof the bar for some time with 2 of his friends. At 6pm, he left, and came back at 10 past 6 with a bag of mcdonalds! He sat down and proceeded to eat. When Callum said "Come on mate, we have people waiting here!", the other guy, name of Alex, shouted that "...I have to have me dinner..!!" . . then proceeding to finishing his burger and get dressed whilst behind the bar!
The issue is the arrogamnce of this indiviudual, and his complete lack of care for the dozen or so customers who were waiting for drinks, not counting myself and my wife who were starving!
I have tried repeatedly to get hold of "Tom" the elusive manager, but as yet to no avail. 
The management needs to do some severe training!!!!
