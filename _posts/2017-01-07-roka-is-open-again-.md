Been for a walk this evening, getting my <a href="/wiki/step+count">step count</a> up. Looks like <a href="/wiki/roka">Roka</a> were telling the truth, they were just shut for christmas and now it's up and running again.

<a href="/wiki/not+drinking">Not drinking</a>, so walked right on past <a href="/wiki/ship">The Ship</a> (looked quiet) and <a href="/wiki/inn+doors">The Inn Doors</a> (looked busy).

<a href="/wiki/spice+cottage">Spice Cottage</a> is closed though. For January only?
