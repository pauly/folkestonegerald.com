<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk">BBC reports</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4300187.stm">a man spotted on the tracks of the channel tunnel</a>... There was three hours delay while the power was turned off and the was searched for... 
Police officers and Eurotunnel staff later found the man who had boarded a train near the terminal entrance. This was about 4am Saturday, where were you..? Was it a refugee or a pissed up clubber?
