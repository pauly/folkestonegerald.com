Can't believe a) the forerunner of "make that bit of Folkestone nice" has closed, but also b) I had to be told of it by people who live out of town. I was down there the other day in <a href="/wiki/13cc">13cc</a> and did not notice anything.

<a href="/wiki/googies">Googies</a> was quite good, did they just overstretch themselves? Guess it did not work as well as a bar in the double sized premises. Good luck if you start again Mr Googies!
