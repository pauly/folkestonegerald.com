No not a secretary type, I need a PA, two decks, two CD players, a mic and a mixer for a party, anyone know where I can get a good deal? Had no joy on a local musicians forum, can anyone reading this help? Need it for a Friday night in August, delivered ideally. If I can get some nice flashing lights from the same place, that would be fine. It's for a hall, 120 people or so, so I don't need a wall of amps. Needs to be PAT tested.

Please drop me a mail if you can help, pauly at folkestonegerald.com
