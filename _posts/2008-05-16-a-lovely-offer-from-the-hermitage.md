A contributor to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/folkestone/8/board.html">the forum</a> posted about <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/10904/10476/RE%3A+Sadly+disappointed+with+La+Tavernetta">a disappointing anniversary meal they'd had at a local restaurant</a> in January. And <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/58/The+Hermitage">The Hermitage</a> have chipped in, this story obviously tugged their heart strings like it did mine, but they've actually put their hand in their pocket and are offering the couple in question a free meal!

I must point out that <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/58/The+Hermitage">The Hermitage</a> were not the venue for the original disappointing meal, they're just doing their bit for the general good feeling within our town.

Isn't that beautiful?

Check out <a href="http://www.thehermitagerestaurant.com">thehermitagerestaurant.com</a> to see their menu, and if it was you that posted originally, please get in touch. If you're the proprietor of the original disappointing restaurant, perhaps you'd like to get in touch too and offer us <i>all</i> a free feed?
