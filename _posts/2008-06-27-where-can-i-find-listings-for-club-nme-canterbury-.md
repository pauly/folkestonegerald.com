If you know anyone involved, get them to get in touch with me. I only just found out it had moved from <a href="/wiki/studio+41">Studio 41</a> to the <a href="/wiki/ucca+bar">UCCA bar</a>.

<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=257469012">myspace is no help</a> myspace is awful... is there a facebook group or something I can get listings from? Facebook is awful too though...
