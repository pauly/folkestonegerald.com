Just walked past there too, and it was cunningly disguised as the place I would like to go to LEAST in the world. St George flags everywhere and a big banner advertising Sky Sports. I know a St George cross should not have any negative connotations, and we non racists should be reclaiming it, and if everyone can wear guinness hats and shamrock pants on St Patricks day then why the hell not, but it somehow didn't appeal. I see the flags and the offer of sports and I am put in mind only of a hub of soccer violence on a sink estate...

Happy St Georges day to you all, and good luck to <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a>. Reckon I will be back for a vino collapso and a nice sit down one day when all the paraphernalia has been put away.

(Still walking the streets of <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a> so you don't have to...)
