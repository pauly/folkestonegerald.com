I have been eating there for the last years and I can say, hand on heart that I have never had a bad meal in there,in fact I would go so far to say the food is superb.

They have new owners now and it has got even better.

Give it another try, I was really surprised to have read that,Maybe one of the other Italian restaurants made this post up?

Cheers..
