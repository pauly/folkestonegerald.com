My wife and I called into the Bull Inn for sunday lunch, we eat out ever weekend and this was the first time we had been into the Bull Inn,and it will be the last.We asked the waitress what vegetables came with the roast and was told, carrots, peas and cauliflower,I said I don't like peas so can I have extra carrots. The meal arrived with carrots, PEAS and SWEETCORN, I said I don't eat either of them, can they please take them off and just give me extra carrots, she took the plate away and returned 2 minutes later with the peas & sweetcorn scraped off my plate and no extra carrots or any other veg added.The gravy was like oil and the whole meal was disgusting, The waitress never came back to us at all,We finished what was edible,paid and left,The hospitality was non-existant and the food was vile, what a waste of 20 odd pounds.
