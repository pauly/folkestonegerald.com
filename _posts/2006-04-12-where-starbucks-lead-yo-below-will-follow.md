Hmm, that's another chain, and lots of people don't like them, but I'd rather have a few quality chains like Nandos, Fresh and Wild, Pizza Express and so on, than street after street of independent pound shops.

Is there such a thing as English Sushi? Maybe Folkestone could be the forerunner in it, being on the sea there ought to be more made of this in the restaurants in the town. I don't eat fish myself so am not sure what's about and what's not, but I know I have been laughed out the door for asking if there is somewhere to get nice fresh fish down by the harbour.
