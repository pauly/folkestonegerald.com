I recently visited my old home town for a funeral, and would just like to comment that I am still so happy to see Shepherd & Neame ales in Folkestone.
The first thing my son and I did when arriving at Folkestone West station, was to have a "swift half" in the Nailbox.

One other comment, there's a pub down the fish market. It used to be the <a href="/wiki/oddfellows">Oddfellows</a>, then <a href="/wiki/euphoria">Euphoria</a>, now the <a href="/wiki/three+mackerels">Three Mackerels</a>. What's going on there?
