Folkestone trains are a bit messed up for the whole summer ([year]2005[/year]), possibly the next six months. To travel at about the same time, and not have to change trains at <a href="/wiki/ashford">Ashford</a> or anything we have to get trains to / from Cannon Street instead of Charing Cross... suits me though as we get a stop off at London Bridge, so a bit handier for work. Anyway, look out if you're travelling to / from <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>.

If you're coming to / from <a href="/wiki/dover">Dover</a>, you've had it, got to get a bus.

<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">National Rail is the place to look up train times</a>...

<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/fkc/details.html">Folkestone Central station details</a>, <a href="http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/station.aspx?T=FKC">live departure and arrival boards</a> to and from <a href="/wiki/ashford">Ashford</a>, London and going the other way to <a href="/wiki/ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> and <a href="/wiki/margate">Margate</a>. See the same also for <a href="http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/station.aspx?T=FKW">Folkestone West</a>.

UPDATE: All these times will be changing soon, come the <a href="/wiki/high+speed+rail+link">high speed rail link</a> at the end of [year]2009[/year]. Train times from Ashford to Kings Cross will supposedly be down to 37 minutes (Folkestone being another twenty minutes or more on top of that somehow), but prices will be a lot higher, a two tiered ticket system I assume.
