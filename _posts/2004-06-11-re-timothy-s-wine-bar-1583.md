Gaby - where are you mate ?  Got no answer ? C'mon, we could work together.  Twatter.  I should point out at this point that my sponsor - Pauly - does not necesssarily agree with my views.This is his website and I only contribute.  Pauly is not responsible for my vinditive outbursts.  He lives in London.  I take full responsibility for for my outpourings.  Is anyone brave enough to challenge ?  

Folkestone is ??????? 

Pauly - this is for you - I asked Lucy what she  wanted for dinner tonight and she said very sweetly "bumblebees" (probably worth checking the spelling glitter-boy).
