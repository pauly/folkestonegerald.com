Do not go to this pub, it is rubbish,we waiting over an hour for our food, we had a table of six and two of the meals came out 20 minutes after the first four. Some food was cold, some burnt to a cinders, rude staff, gruesome tv show on while eating, hair in food, on one plate veg had clearly been took off another persons plate, mushrooms raw, totally ruined a special birthday, all the manager could say was its teething problems!
