Just had a GREAT lunch at the <a href="/wiki/black+horse">Black Horse</a>, <a href="/wiki/monks+horton">Monks Horton</a>. Carvery meat for everyone else, but some spectacular big round courgettes stuffed with grilled vegetables for me, and a range of veges. Real cider and coffee too, and very reasonably priced. Then out to play in the garden, Harry liked the play area. Looking forward to going back here again soon. I know normally when we enthuse over somewhere it closes down, but this has only been under new management for a few weeks now so we surely have another chance. Looking forward to taking the rest of the family, and also  trying an evening there too.
