hi guess what I have seen 'Dave'the dolpin again, yesterday I actually swam out and it circled me and my friend it was about a metre away from me. It is a dream come true. Any chance for any extra information on either exactly what type of dolphin it is and are there any clubs you can join so that I could swim with them more officially
