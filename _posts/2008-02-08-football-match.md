Thanks for listing our matches down at Hythe Town FC  all publicity, much appreciated. We're having a great season, playing excellent football, and there is always a friendly welcome (sometimes too friendly and you get roped into helping, like I did). For venue information, please feel free to link to our website, <a href="http://www.hythetownfc.co.uk">hythetownfc.co.uk</a>.

Really like the site.
