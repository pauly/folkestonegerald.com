The property supplement in today's <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk">Evening Substandard</a> has a double page spread on how great Folkestone is. It's mostly about the bloody artists in the <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter">Creative Quarter</a>, but it's better than nothing. They make Folkestone sound more expensive than I thought it was though, have <a href="/wiki/property+pricess">property pricess</a> really boosted then?
