Well, this video came up when I <a href="/wiki/searched+for+folkestone">searched for Folkestone</a>, is that in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>? Where? Some of it looks like <a href="/wiki/broadmead">Broadmead village</a> and some of it looks like <a href="/wiki/hawkinge">Hawkinge</a>... is it round here or just mis-labelled?
