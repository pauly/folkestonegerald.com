It's almost time to dig out the lights, baubles and tinsel. Christmas is just around the corner, and it's an exciting year to celebrate the season in East Kent with the official launch of Melocard, the discount card for kent, at the Folkestone Christmas Spectacular.

On the 28th of November, Folkestone is putting on one of the best all-day Christmas events in the county, with festive music, reindeer, dazzling decorations, great food, Father Christmas, and of course, Melocards! Your Melocard will give you exclusive discounts at over 80 local shops and businesses, from coffees to flowers to spa treatments to home stereos. What better way to gift yourself this season than with cash savings?

Melocards cost just 10, and give you deals and discounts until March 2011. They can be purchased online at <a href="http://www.melocard.com/getacard">melocard.com/getacard</a>, or on 28 November at any Melocard InfoPoint in Folkestone.

When you get your Melocard on or before 28 November, you'll also get exclusive access to the first ever Melocard Christmas Treasure Trail - a festive prize hunt where you can enter to win loads of exciting gifts in shops across Kent. 'Tis the season to be jolly you know!
