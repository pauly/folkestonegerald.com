<blockquote>HISTORICAL GUIDED WALK

We invite you to take part in a FREE guided historical walk lead by local Historian <a href="/wiki/ian+coulson">Ian Coulson</a> and <a href="/wiki/joy+davies">Joy Davies</a> of the Ramblers association on Tuesday 20th September, meeting at the <a href="/wiki/roman+villa">Roman villa</a> excavation site on Folkestone's East cliff at 10.30am and walking to Castle Hill and back, finishing around 12.30pm.

The route is via The Valiant Sailor up to Castle Hill then back at lower level and therefore is open to all as is flat most of the way, the steepest incline being the path to the Valiant Sailor.

Open to anyone interested in hearing about local history on this attractive route.       No booking required.

EAST CLIFF EXCAVATION

We are still seeking new or returning/regular volunteers to help during the rest of the month at the East cliff at the excavation as there is still a lot to do and time is running out!  Please do come along even if for half a day to help, you can come along any day, no need to book your time in, 7 days a week, just before 9am or 1.30pm.  Many thanks.
