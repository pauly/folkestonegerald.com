<a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh+festival">The Mighty Boosh festival</a> lineup is out, as seen on posters at Folkestone station, though I'm sure I could have been quicker off the mark than that. It's a bit ropey actually. The 'Boosh themselves headline I think, with <a href="/wiki/charlatans">The Charlatans</a>, <a href="/wiki/gary+numan">Gary Numan</a>, <a href="/wiki/white+denim">White Denim</a>, <a href="/wiki/kills">The Kills</a>, <a href="/wiki/peaches">Peaches</a> (DJing only), and <a href="/wiki/polar+bear">Polar Bear</a>. I've no idea of the format actually, so i'm not sure what part <a href="/wiki/noel+fielding">Noel Fielding</a>, <a href="/wiki/julian+barrett">Julian Barrett</a> et all will play. 

There is a full comedy lineup too featuring <a href="/wiki/ross+noble">Ross Noble</a>, <a href="/wiki/frankie+boyle">Frankie Boyle</a>, <a href="/wiki/flight+of+the+conchords">Flight Of The Conchords</a>, <a href="/wiki/robin+ince">Robin Ince</a>, <a href="/wiki/garth+merengi">Garth Merengi</a> and lots more. Not much that really leaps out, I expect to see <a href="/wiki/stewart+lee">Stewart Lee</a> on every single comedy festival lineup, and I expect him to be doing the same set every time too damn it!

It'a at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2482/The+Hop+Farm">the Hop Farm, near Paddock Wood</a>, looks to be about half a mile away from the station so maybe we could do it from Folkestone... think they're gearing it more at people nipping out of London rather than us, but there must be some people that <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2482/The+Hop+Farm/map">Paddock Wood</a> is handy for.
