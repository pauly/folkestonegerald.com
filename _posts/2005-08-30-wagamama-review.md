Had lunch at <a href="/wiki/wagamama">Wagamama</a> in <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> on Saturday, for the first time since this new branch opened. It was busy, but not as crowded as some lunching venues are, so we got seated quickly. I love <a href="/wiki/wagamama">Wagamama</a>, but haven't been for a while, we usually head straight for Nando's when we're up this way. First difference from my previous "positive eating" experiences was glaring - I was driving, so NO <a href="/wiki/plum+wine">plum wine</a>. This perhaps coloured the rest of the meal for me. <a href="/wiki/clare">Clare</a> went for <a href="/wiki/yaki+soba">Yaki Soba</a>, and the chicken in it wasn't that nice - it looked a bit grey to me. My <a href="/wiki/yasai+katsu+curry">Yasai Katsu Curry</a> was just as I remembered it it, and the <a href="/wiki/yasai+gyoza">Yasai Gyoza</a> on the side were good too, if maybe a bit squidgy. With soft drinks this came to 23 quid, not outrageous, but we could have spent less elsewhere. Worst point of all was we felt a bit fat and sluggish for the rest of the day, though we both had it in our minds this would be a healthy option for lunch.

So, to sum up, it was nice, and this is not a bad review.
