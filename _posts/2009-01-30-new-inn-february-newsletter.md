<blockquote>Welcome to the February newsletter for The New Inn, Etchinghill. We are updating our mailing list - hopefully we have your correct details and you still wish to receive our monthly newsletter.

Special upcoming events for February are:

    *
      Launch of Art at The New Inn with a dynamic Photography Exhibition by Karin Albinsson** (Sunday 15th February)
    *
      Ever-popular Black Tie Dinner with a fantastic 3-course menu (Friday 27th February).
    *
      Valentine's Dinner with complimentary bottle of wine for each table of four (Saturday 14th February) 

** CALLING ALL ARTISTS, PHOTOGRAPHERS AND SCULPTORS!

Each month, The New Inn will feature a selection of work from a hand-picked artist, sculptor or photographer. We are delighted to announce that our very first 'Artist of the Month' will be award-winning documentary photographer, Karin Albinsson. Originally hailing from Sweden, Karin is now based in Manchester where she has worked with named-artists such as  <a href="/wiki/oasis">Oasis</a>, <a href="/wiki/paul+weller">Paul Weller</a>, <a href="/wiki/smiths">The Smiths</a> and <a href="/wiki/stone+roses">The Stone Roses</a>. Fresh from an assignment in the Sahara Desert (where she travelled by motorbike!) documenting the nomadic Berber people, Karin will join us in our artists grotto during lunchtime on Sunday 15th Feb. In addition, Karin has offered to take a free documentary portrait for each couple attending the Valentine's Dinner - an amazing opportunity!

Full details & stunning photography from this month's ARTIST IN RESIDENCE can be found at:  <a href="http://www.new-inn.info">new-inn.info</a>

Thank you!
