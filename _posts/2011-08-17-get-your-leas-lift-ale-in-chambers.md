This from the facebook:
<blockquote>We are proud & lucky to be the FIRST PUB in Folkestone to stock the LEAS LIFT ALE! A 3.8% locally brewed pale ale with a benefit in every glass. 
For every pint drunk 10p goes towards the Lift trust so as you quaff this damned fine ale you can reassure yourself that you're providing a bit more longevity for your towns most iconic landmark. Well done you!!
Official launch this Thurs but ale on sale from Weds.</blockquote>
