Sellindge Music Festival apologises for any misunderstanding brought forth from the publication of the article "The Secret Behind Zoo Thousand and Nine". SMF does not claim to know if Red List Live does or does not employ all of the same organisers as for the ZOO8 festival. Unfortunately, SMF cannot monitor and/or be responsible for every article of press written and published, or for the views of the writers, but sincerely apologise for any misunderstanding.
