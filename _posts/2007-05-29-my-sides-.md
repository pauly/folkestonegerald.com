Ho ho, just read <a href="http://www.thespoof.com/news/spoof.cfm?headline=s3i19325&rating=1#rating this spoof story]]" title="We (work) are selling tickets to this Dickens theme park, that's one of our websites...">about [[http://www.dickensworld-shortbreaks.co.uk/ Dickens World</a>.

<blockquote>A new 62 million theme park is being built in Chatham Maritime in Kent on a Dickensian theme in the hope of attracting foreign visitors in the same way that Fawlty Towers drew tourists into the Torquay area in the 1980's.

Visitors will be greeted by slack-jawed pickpockets and opium addicted whores and that's just the Folkestone ferry-port.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The story above is a satire or parody. It is entirely fictitious.</blockquote>

Apart from Folkestone not having a working ferry port right now, I'm not so sure...
