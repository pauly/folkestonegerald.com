To all concerned with Knotweed Pulling - be very careful.
You may well increase the spread of the plant by pulling it out of the ground.  It is not a recognised method of control.
Not wanting to dampen the enthusiasm of the local community, but trust me when I say BE CAREFUL!!
There are much more effective methods of control and if pulling is to be done it would need to be done for a number of years (10+) to be effective.  There are also legal issues regarding the transportation and disposal of Japanese Knotweed as it is classed as a Controlled Waste and subjected to the Waste Carrying License etc etc.
For further information please visit www.t-c-m-rd.co.uk or other sites such as the Cornwall Knotweed Forum web site.
Many thanks
