<blockquote>Just to let you all know that Number Eleven will be serving refreshing Pimms, and fruit sorbets to accompany <a href="/wiki/charivari">ChariVari</a> carnival which is due to pass the restaurant around 2pm.

The team will also be representing down at Sunny Sands on Sunday for the <a href="/wiki/sandcastle+competition">Sandcastle competition</a>. We are thinking of designing a prawn or fish shaped sandcastle in keeping with the culinary theme, if you have a suggestion or preference then let us know! Half the money raised will go to The Church Street Project and half to Cancer Research. Pop in and sponsor us and we will post the pictures of the final sandcastle next week</blockquote>.
