<blockquote>As you may or may not know, <a href="/wiki/strange+cargo">Strange Cargo</a> are collecting residents' memories of Folkestone for a book they are putting together.  In support of this and because the deadline for entries is fast approaching we thought we would send this message to spread the word and to ask you to contribute if you can.  <a href="http://www.strangecargo.org.uk/news/2010/folkestone-triennial/Information">about the project can be found here</a>.

You just need to write a few lines on your memories, 'quirky knowledge' etc on a site, place or object in Folkestone.  You can either phone
01303 244533 or send an email to info@strangecargo.org.uk.</blockquote>
