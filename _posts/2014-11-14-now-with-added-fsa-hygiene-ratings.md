I've updated the site with FSA ratings, covering not just hygiene but also "confidence in management" and "structure", still not quite sure what they all mean but I'm buying right into it... Check out any venue link on the site and where possibly I'm showing the ratings. I'm really pleased that <a href="http://ratings.food.gov.uk">ratings.food.gov.uk</a> has such an easy to use <a href="/wiki/api">API</a>, I wonder if there's more I can do with this. Got a <a href="/wiki/hackathon">hackathon</a> coming up at work, hmm...

Some venues are going to like this - say <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/chambers/pub-real-ale-restaurant-venue-4/index.html">Chambers</a> - are going to like this. Others less so...
