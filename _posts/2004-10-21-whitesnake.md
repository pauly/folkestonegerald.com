Been a bit slow off the mark on this one, but <a href="http://www.wayahead.com/livegigpopex/price.asp?filler1=livegigpopex">Whitesnake are playing Leas Cliff Hall</a> on November 24th, the day after <a href="/wiki/motorhead">Motorhead</a>... 32 QUID??? Will it attract much the same audience, is Folkestone big enough to support these two events in a row..?
