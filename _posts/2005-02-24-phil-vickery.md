<a href="http://www.thepublican.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=16437&d=11">This article</a> on <a href="http://www.thepublican.com">thepublican.com</a> says TV chef <a href="/wiki/phil+vickery">Phil Vickery</a> is from Folkestone, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/chef_biogs/v.shtml">this BBC profile</a> confirms it! He's not to be confused with <a href="http://www.philvickery.com">the rugby player</a>, he is a cooker, not a fighter.

<a href="http://www.thepublican.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=16437&d=11">Interesting feature</a> anyway, about <a href="/wiki/shepherds+neame">Shepherds Neame</a>. "The company makes a feature of sourcing as many of its food ingredients as it can from local suppliers", we like that...
