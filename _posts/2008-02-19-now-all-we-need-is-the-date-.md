did you see any other bands there? I've heard of a few others playing there, it was on the indie circuit, but no-one's sure of actual dates. <a href="/wiki/suede">Suede</a> played there, that's one I do have a date for, as it's in their biography <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Suede-Love-Poison-Authorised-Biography/dp/0233000941/">Love and Poison</a>. I hear <a href="/wiki/faith+no+more">Faith No More</a> played there, and <a href="/wiki/pj+harvey">PJ Harvey</a> too.
