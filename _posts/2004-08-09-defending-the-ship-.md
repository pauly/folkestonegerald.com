Sorry to hear you had a bad experience at the Ship. I've eaten there many many times and had great food, especially the fish and chips - always the biggest piece of fhish you can imagine and fresh chunky chips. 

I can also heartily recommend the steak and kidney pudding.

It's great that pubs like this still exist, I dread the day when every local is replaced my souless, stale All Bar Ones.

Shame no apology was offered for your dining experience but at least a refund was given.
