Radiohead did play the Penny Theatre in Jan 1993, I promoted it, it was the last ever Expos night. It was their first ever sell out gig outside of London or Oxford and was rammed to the rafters (we had over 300 people in there). They covered Rhinestone Cowboy as an encore, which I believe they used to do early on but hadnt done for years (and as far as I am aware) havent done since. I have a tape of the gig recorded from the mixing desk.

Bands who also played the Penny included The Cranberries, Jamiroquai, Skunk Anansie, Supergrass, Bluetones, Ash, Dodgy. We narrowly missed out on Elastica, Oasis and Belly  either through short sightedness or bad luck.
