Woo, <a href="http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14049-2325778,00.html">we're in The Times today</a>:
<blockquote>After a long period of static or falling prices, property prices are up by just under 3 per cent since the start of this year  a modest rise perhaps, but a stronger rise than in other South Coast resorts such as Ramsgate and Hastings, according to the property data company Hometrack. Now Folkestone is fizzing like a bottle of pop and no mistake.</blockquote>
