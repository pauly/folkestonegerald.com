There's a new <a href="/wiki/mexican">Mexican</a> in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> AND there is a <a href="/wiki/costa">Costa</a> on the way! It's all go! Not sure whether a <a href="/wiki/costa">Costa</a> is specifically wanted or needed or a good thing, but the fact that people are opening new business in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> is great.
