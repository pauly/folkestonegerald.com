There's a great book on the history of Folkestone pubs [abe]Tales From The Tap Room[/abe] (or [ebay=tales from the tap room]try ebay[/ebay]), but I'll go down there and have a look... <a href="/wiki/tontine+street">Tontine Street</a> is all redeveloped now, <a href="/wiki/creative+foundation">The Creative Foundation</a> are buying the whole lot up.
