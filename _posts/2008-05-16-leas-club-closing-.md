I heard a rumour from two places the last couple of days (perhaps it was in this week's paper?) that the Leas Club is closing, and the site being redeveloped as flats. Can anyone confirm or deny?

Do we really need more flats?

UPDATE: duh yeah it was the front page story in this week's Herald. The Leas Club is closing as a "nightspot" when the land is redeveloped, but the club itself must remain as it is listed. Will it just be boarded up? What will it be used for? It would be lovely to see it turned back into a theatre, which apparently it was until 1986.
