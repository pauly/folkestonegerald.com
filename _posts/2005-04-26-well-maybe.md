If you come back to popex! I have moved to Folkestone now (been doing it gradually for the last year, and made the proper move about a month back), and was thinking of coming to the <a href="/wiki/richard+herring">Richard Herring</a> show... are you local then? I did keep seeing your name crop up in the local paper ents section...

I have to confess, I never sent in the money I pledged for your parachute jump, I should do something about that.
