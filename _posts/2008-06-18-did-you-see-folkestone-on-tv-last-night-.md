<a href="/wiki/slight+repost">Slight repost</a> from <a href="/wiki/blog">the blog</a>, but didn't we look nice on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cultureshow">The Culture Show</a> last night?

An aside, <a href="/wiki/vic+reeves">Vic Reeves</a> said on the show last night that he lived in Folkestone for two years, in a flat overlooking the sea. Some misspeaking there I think, I believe he lived in the huge house opposite our flat on <a href="/wiki/earls+avenue">Earls Avenue</a>. He would know better than I, but can you back up my beliefs with FACT?

See <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b00c74n9.shtml">last night's Culture Show</a> on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">BBC iPlayer</a>.
