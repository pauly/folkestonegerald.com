5 of us when to The new 66 Steakhouse on Saturday 18th, firstly we were a little late, but we were put on a semi circle that is only comfortable for 4 people, so we had to get a chair on the end,The light above us was very hot and was on very bright we asked to turn it down after a fair amount of fuss the light was turned down, we ordered drinks that took an age to come,the young girl who served us was not very confident and was a bit clumsy she said Shit when she nearly spilt my drink, the staff were not as friendly as we would hope, 

The 5 steaks we ordered (simple order in a steakhouse you would think) took an hour and a half???? The side salad was very plain and the chips cooked 3 times? disappointing, could be lovely as location is.
