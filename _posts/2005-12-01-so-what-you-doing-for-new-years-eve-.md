Now we're into the final furlong, New Years Eve is showing up on the front page calendar... and what are the options? I really don't know, the only thing I have is this do at <a href="/wiki/grand">The Grand</a>, though at 65 a ticket I think we'll pass.

If you know of a party or special event in the area, please <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/cgi-bin/calendar.cgi?table=event&mode=add">add it here</a>, it'll go on the site and in the mailout. If you'd like the weekly mailout, please  <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/cgi-bin/register.cgi">sign up here</a>.

Cheers!
