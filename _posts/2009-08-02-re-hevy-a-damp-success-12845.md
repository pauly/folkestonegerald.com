Was An Awesome Day once i arrived as of traffic on m25 and m20 but had a great day!! Ash were immense and feeder were pretty good too!!Loads Of the other bands were good too! There Was Also Some really Awesome unsigned acts playing some i feel were missed by all such as Kent based band Eleven Eleven (www.eleven-eleven.co.uk) Who opened The Third Stage and were also winners of KentTV's Soundclash 2009!
