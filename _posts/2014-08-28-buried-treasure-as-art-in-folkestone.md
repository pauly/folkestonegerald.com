<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/28/gold-sand-folkestone-beach-artist-michael-sailstorfer?CMP=twt_gu">Here in the Guardian</a>, German artist <a href="/wiki/michael+sailstorfer">Michael Sailstorfer</a> has buried 10k worth of gold bullion in the sand of the Outer Harbour beach, Folkestone.

Someone on the guardian comments works out the bars must be 12g of gold each, that is pretty small. 1 tablespoon of sugar is about that weight, and gold is pretty dense, surely these will be about the size of a staple.

This stunt is part of <a href="/wiki/folkestone+triennial">Folkestone Triennial</a>.

UPDATE: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/live/2014/aug/28/folkestone-gold-hunt-as-art-the-search-for-10000-bullion-live">Guardian are live blogging it</a>.
