<a href="/wiki/toolstation">Toolstation</a> are now in with <a href="/wiki/wickes">Wickes</a>, that's an interesting move. Well, interesting if you go to <a href="/wiki/diy">DIY</a> stores a lot, it will probably increase my likelihood of heading to <a href="/wiki/wickes">Wickes</a> when I need something instead of <a href="/wiki/b+q">B&Q</a>.

There's a free screwdriver waiting for me if I go in there with the postcard they just sent me too, result!
