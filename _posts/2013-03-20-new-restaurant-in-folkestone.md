Sounds good, if a bit fishy for me, will have to check it out. Clare and others had a very enjoyable evening in <a href="/wiki/rocksalt">RockSalt</a> without me last weekend. Not specifically enjoyable because I wasn't there I hope.

<blockquote><a href="/wiki/blooms+the+quarter">Blooms @ the Quarter</a> is a new restaurant at 2-4 <a href="/wiki/south+street">South Street</a>, which will officially open to the public on Friday 22 March.
Blooms will be a contemporary restaurant with a theatre style kitchen, serving good quality Italian/Mediterranean food. The menu will be simple and will include freshly prepared dishes from hand stretched pizzas, fresh local fish, pasta, risottos, grilled meats, salads & fresh homemade bread.
As well as a bar area to relax in, whether one is waiting for ones table or just with friend for a coffee, they aim to deliver a fast, friendly and professional standard of service from the front of house team who will have an excellent knowledge of wines, cocktails and the menu.
Owner <a href="/wiki/phil+godden">Phil Godden</a> has grown up in Folkestone and spent his child hood growing up around the harbour, and has been a local business man for many years. The head chef <a href="/wiki/james+pearce">James Pearce</a> & bar/restaurant manager <a href="/wiki/andrew+wintie">Andrew Wintie</a> are both also local guys and share a love and passion for food and drink.</blockquote>
