Seems to be a constant stream of closures at the moment, this town feels like it's dying on its arse at times. I had not been in the <a href="/wiki/earl+grey">Earl Grey</a> for a long time, it wasn't a very appealing pub, but it feels like we ought to be able to support more pubs than we have. I guess the strongest will survive.
