The evidence cited in support would be that most locals there are firmly behind a planned shopping development, <a href="http://money.guardian.co.uk/consumerissues/story/0,14150,1501025,00.html">says the Guardian</a>... I think the HMV is a GOOD THING, not so sure about Asda but who knows. We have plenty of little independent shops, and there's no danger of them being washed away, it's the one's down the main stretch of the (new) High Street that need to worry, and they're all rubbish anyway.

<a href="http://www.mjhibbett.com">Friend of mine</a> has done a song about why this hysteria about town centres becoming clones of each other is all rubbish too, I hope you can <a href="http://www.mjhibbett.com">find it on his website</a>, it's called <a href="http://mjhibbett.tripod.com/2004_01_11_songbloghistory.htm">City Centres</a>. Aha, it's available on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00027EFXO/q">Shed Anthems</a>, along with "Things'll Be Different (When I'm In Charge)", "The Fair Play Trophy (again)", "Billy Jones Is Dead", "The Primal Rhythms Of The Bolivian Nose Flautist", and "Let The Weird Band Win". It's brilliant, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00027EFXO/q"> you should get it</a>...
