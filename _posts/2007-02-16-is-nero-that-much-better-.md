I can't remember the name of the one I like, possibly it's Nero, is that the one in the wonky old building in the middle of <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a>?

Where <a href="/wiki/costa">Costa</a> and <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> lead maybe the others will follow... having a <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> in town's got to be a good thing though, hasn't it?

Welcome to the board btw, you posted here before?
