One of your local District Nurses for the Hawkinge community, Jacqui Buxton would like to enlist your help in the battle to fight breast cancer.
 This terrible disease touches too many people's lives, every month causing more than 1,000 deaths in the UK alone and not just women either - breast cancer affects many men too !
'Breakthrough Breast Cancer' is the UK's leading charity committed to fighting breast cancer through research and education. Their essence comes from the thousands of people who are committed to a single vision - to work for a future free from the fear of breast cancer.
Jacqui knows from personal experience the devastating effect that cancer can have on a family  that's why I've taken up Breakthrough's 'GREAT WALL CHALLENGE' - it's my way of celebrating and honouring my mother and all of the people I have met as patients who we sadly lost to cancer. The Prima Great Wall Discovery 2007 in aid of Breakthrough Breast Cancer is a 100km walk along the Great Wall of China beginning 11th May 2007. I have pledged to raise a total of 2,500 by February 2007 for this Charity, I am organizing charity events such as quiz evenings and pamper days and would deeply appreciate any help or donation you can make.?
 You may donate in several ways, either by donating a prize for one of the fundraising evenings, some Time by volunteering to help fundraising , by cheque (payable to 'Breakthrough Breast Cancer') or by donating online through this secure web address - <a href="http://www.bmycharity.com/jacquichina">bmycharity.com/jacquichina</a>. 
 
<blockquote>I will be most happy to publicise any corporate donations during the walk itself and also beforehand in all of my fundraising activities</blockquote>
<blockquote>I'm very proud to be supporting vital breast cancer research and would encourage others to get involved and give money for someone they love. 
Thanks for your support and remember - together we can make a difference!</blockquote>
