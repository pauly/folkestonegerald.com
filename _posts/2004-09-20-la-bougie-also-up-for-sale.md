A slightly more serious 455,000 for this one, though that includes a 3 bedroom flat and it's a nice part of town... <a href="http://www.smith-woolleyandperry.co.uk">Smith-Woolley & Perry</a> are in charge of this:

<blockquote>The premises are situated within <a href="/wiki/sandgate+conservation+area">Sandgate Conservation Area</a> on the A259 coastal road, within walking distance to the beach in an established retail area mainly given over to antique shops and restaurants. Folkestone town centre is approximately 1 miles distant and access to the M20 and <a href="/wiki/channel+tunnel+terminal">Channel Tunnel Terminal</a> at <a href="/wiki/cheriton">Cheriton</a> are within approximately 2 miles. Ground floor restaurant with approx. 50 covers and separate three bedroom maisonette above. At the rear of the restaurant is an 'L' shaped drinks bar. At the rear is a fully equipped kitchen and wc accommodation.</blockquote>
