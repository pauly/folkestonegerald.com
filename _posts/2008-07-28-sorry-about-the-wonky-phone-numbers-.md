I've had a problem on the site with some of the phone numbers getting corrupted:
<blockquote>Please can you change the tiger inns number as its on alot of your telephone numbers for businesses in folkstone ie.. imperial hotel, burstan hotel, hawkinge community centre, mustangs pub and many more!
we recieve about 50 calls early and late through out the day and all the people that call say they found the number on folkstone gerald.</blockquote>
Pretty exciting that so many people are using the site, why do more of you not leave a message?
