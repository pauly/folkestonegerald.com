Kevin Dewsbury

As soon as he steps on stage the audience quickly realise they are in the company of a natural born performer, his material ranges from storytelling, observations on daily life and killer one liners, he is also faultless at mimicking accents. Due to his impeccable comic timing Kevin is guaranteed to leave crowds wanting more of his top-notch humour and because of this, he was snapped up to perform at the Edinburgh Festival in the sell out Big Value Comedy Late Show 2004 and has recently completed a national tour with 'Joke Machine' Tim Vine. He is also constantly sought after for his acting work, most recently appearing in an advert for Natwest Student Bank Accounts and is currently working on a television project with Perrier Newcomer Will Hodgson.
