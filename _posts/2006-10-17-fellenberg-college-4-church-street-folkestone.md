In the 19th century, there was a Ladies' College in Church Street, Folkestone, which was named Fellenberg College - also known as Fellenberg House Seminary.

I have found it listed in a few of the historical directories, but then it disappeared in the 1880s.  I have also found it in a few of the censuses, but again - nothing after 1881.

I have searched the internet and although I have found a fleeting mention of the college, I haven't really been able to find out anything.

Please - can anyone with local knowledge help me?  It is likely that the name is based on the Swiss educator named Fellenberg, who (at that time) was a pioneer in certain types of education.

There is a very brief summary of him and his methods here:

Thanks in advance for any help.

As I live in Adelaide, South Australia, it's a bit far to come to check it out for myself.
