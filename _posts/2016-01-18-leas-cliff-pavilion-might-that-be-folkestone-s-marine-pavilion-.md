Just looking for mentions of <a href="/wiki/marine+pavilion">Marine Pavilion</a> in my archives, now I see it is <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/former-nightclub-demolition-to-begin-59403">about to be demolished</a>. That's the <a href="/wiki/parisienne">Parisienne</a> / <a href="/wiki/grizzly+den">Grizzly Den</a> / <a href="/wiki/bonkers">Bonkers</a> nightclub of course, more recently known as <a href="/wiki/onyx">Onyx</a> (though not by anyone that I've ever spoken to).

Every time I saw mentions of gigs at <a href="/wiki/folkestone+pavilion">Folkestone Pavilion</a> I though it was that place up <a href="/wiki/wear+bay+road">Wear Bay Road</a> of that name, but of course it is more likely to have been the night club that I now know was known as Marine Pavilion.

Cheerio anyway rubbish nightclub. I went there about ten years ago, it was not very good and will not be missed.
