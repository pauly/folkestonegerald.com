According to <a href="http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/Pubs-cry-into-their-beer.4840430.jp">this story from Fareham</a>, does it apply across the whole Wetherspoons chain?

<blockquote>Community pubs say there is no way they can match Wetherspoon's, which has slashed the prices of drinks at its pubs.

The pub is selling pints of Greene King IPA ale and bottles of San Miguel lager for under a pound  and says the price drop is 'indefinite'.</blockquote>

No mention of it on <a href="http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk">jdwetherspoon.co.uk</a> yet.
