<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/947243/">Dirty Pretty Things tickets</a> are <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/947243/"> on sale now</a>, they're coming to us on the 15th of December... this is former <a href="/wiki/libertine">Libertine</a> <a href="/wiki/carl+barat">Carl Barat</a> and it's sure to sell out like *SNAP* that.

I got mine, see you there. Unless you are <a href="/wiki/pete+doherty">Pete Doherty</a>, then that's not very likely is it.
