The links were just links to search this site for previous mentions of those acts, as I thought I already had <a href="/wiki/skid+row">Skid Row</a> in the listings somewhere - wasn't it <a href="/wiki/gary+moore">Gary Moore</a>'s band, or some other connection with <a href="/wiki/thin+lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>? I think <a href="/wiki/thin+lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a> used to be called <a href="/wiki/skid+row">Skid Row</a>. 

I have only seen the American '80s cock rockers <a href="/wiki/skid+row">Skid Row</a> (<a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/gig/Motley-Crue-Wembley-Arena/9846.html">not once</a>, <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/gig/Guns-n-Roses-Wembley-Stadium/342.html">not twice</a>, but <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/gig/Skid-Row-Docklands-Arena/9859.html">three times</a>) , and someone's responded to that, and unfortunately that's the top result that came up here when you search for <a href="/wiki/skid+row">Skid Row</a>. Aha, <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/gig/Skid-Row-Leas-Cliff-Hall/305.html">knew I had it somewhere</a>, I have them down as playing the LCH in 1970.

Capisce?

Look, I even made your youtube post into an embedded video. Always good to have you back here Mick!
