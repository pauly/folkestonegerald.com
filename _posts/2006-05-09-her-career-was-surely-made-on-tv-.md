She would not be touring big venues like this if she'd not got lucky on that "The Cruise" documentary, would she? I didn't see that and I've seen her on TV, so it's not like she made an <a href="/wiki/eddie+izzard">Eddie Izzard</a> style stand against TV or anything.

I'm sure she's a lovely lady though.
