We have <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=180695642767&ssPageName=ADME:B:SS:GB:1123">one of these</a>, they are ace. I would like another. But now Habitat has gone under, what to do? Of course you can <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=180695642767&ssPageName=ADME:B:SS:GB:1123">buy one one ebay</a> (collect from Canterbury), that's where we got ours... Started at only 99p, still only a tenner now, would have been two hundred quid new. You want a <a href="/wiki/habitat+radius+bench">Habitat Radius bench</a> to accompany it. Happy bidding!
