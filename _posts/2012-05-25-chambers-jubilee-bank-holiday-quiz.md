Is there a quiz on next Sunday (3rd June) or not? It's the first Sunday of the month so there would normally be, and with it being a super bank holiday it's a particularly good night for one. And we have babysitters so can go to it!

The Chambers are <a href="http://twitter.com/thechambersbar">on twitter now</a>, so even if you hate facebook as much as I do you can now pester them on the social networks until they respond...

UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/TheChambersBar/status/206361699991830528/photo/1And">they did respond</a>, the quiz is on, excellent:
