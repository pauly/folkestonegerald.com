<blockquote>we are getting off a ship in Dover at 5:30 am we catch the Chunnel to Paris at 10:35. Can we make it. How do we make it. Is there a train. Is there a fast train,</blockquote>

Guess that means this site is confusing to use. Odd sort of journey though, can you not go from Ashford to Paris? I thought they'd been reinstated. Anyway, yes there is a train that will do this, kind of, see <a href="http://nationalrail.co.uk">nationalrail.co.uk</a> for that info. If it's today, well I'm too late for you. If it's tomorrow, you will still have trouble as there's a tube strike on so not sure of the best way from Charing Cross (where the London bound train probably terminates) to Kings Cross St Pancras.

There will be a new <a href="/wiki/high+speed+rail+link">high speed rail link</a> straight to St Pancras, starting later this year.
