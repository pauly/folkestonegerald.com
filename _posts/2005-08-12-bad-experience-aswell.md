We stopped off at The Ship Inn, Dymchurch on our way home from a lovely dayout and we had our two children aged 3 and 5 with us, we were told that the good would be about 30 minute wait, so we ordered our food and went into the garden for the children to play, 55 minutes later we were still waiting for our food, so I went into the bar, she retook down what I had ordered and came back saying that it would be another 10 to 20 minutes, so went back outside, with the children asking where there food was, the time being 8.25pm.

At 8.45pm the barmaid came out to say they had no ham for the childrens ham and chips, so showing they had made no effort to make our food, At 9 o'ckock our food finally came, minus my husbands dinner, so they checked and bought that out, his rice was tastless and stodgy and the childrens chips tasted like they had been fried with fish, so we were not happy with our meal, what we having to eat in the dark, and unfortunately we had no offer of a refund, so regardless to say if we are ever in that area again we shall not be going anywhere near that pub or recommending it to any friends.
