it's on from the Monday 20th to Saturday 25th of September, so we'll miss it all, but you shouldn't. Various venues, various times, various prices, highlights seem to me to be <a href="/wiki/clarissa+dickson-wright">Clarissa Dickson-Wright</a>, <a href="/wiki/john+hegley">John Hegley</a> and <a href="/wiki/william+hague">William Hague</a>... see <a href="http://www.folkestonelitfest.com">folkestonelitfest.com</a> for more details.
