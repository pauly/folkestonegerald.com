<blockquote> A campaign to raise funds for a national memorial to fallen Gurkha soldiers has been launched.

Supporters want a statue to be erected on the cliffs above Folkestone, Kent, where the 2nd Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles are based.

Folkestone town councillor Dhan Gurung who is leading the campaign said "some 45,000 Gurkhas have laid down their lives for Britain" over the years.

The memorial is likely to be a statue of a Gurkha in full battle dress</blockquote>
