The Future of Ashford Rocks.

Some of you may have heard through the grapevine that Ashford Rocks is closing, Well at least in the near future

IT IS NOT. The situation is that I have an agreement with Ashford Town FC to hold these functions. Unfortunately Ashford Town FC and their landlords Ashford Holdings have had a disagreement and the consequence of this is that the Landlords have changed the locks and expelled Ashford Town FC.

They have however agreed that Ashford Rocks can continue for the near future, there may however be new tenants at Homelands that may not share our and your taste in music and they may want to stop the Ashford Rocks shows.

Your Support is Needed.

I would like to ask that as many of you as is possible come to the next shows, if we want to carry on with Ashford Rocks we may need to prove to any new tenant that this is what we want, only by turning up in force can we show that Ashford and you want regular Rock Gigs here, so please turn up in your numbers and support the next few gigs, together we can show any new tenant that we want these things to continue.

This is not bullshit, it is reality. People Power almost always wins, so please support me on this.

Thank you one and all. Apologies if you have received this more than once, I have just blasted everybody I can think of, It's your call, Spread the word.

Steve, Organiser Ashford Rocks !
