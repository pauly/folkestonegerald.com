I don't know whether anyone can help. I am researching my family tree and am
trying to investigate some history of Elham and Folkestone.

My grandfather was born in Elham in 1908, and his sister also in 1907. Their
mother, my great grandmother came from North Wales. Her name was Ellen Owens
and she apparently owned, or ran, or worked in a guest house in Elham. She
moved there from London, where she had been 'in service'.

She met my great grandfather there when he and his band stayed at the guest
house. He gave her their 2 children.

My great grandfather was a dutch musician, born in the Netherlands in 1868.
He was a violinist, and came to this country, touring Britain with various
bands, including his own, eventually.

His name was Willem de Lange Wendels, and I know that he was asked to play
with Herr Wilhelm Morgann and his Hungarian Blue Band around 1904/1905. I
suspect that he may have known, or played with Herr Moritz Wurm and his Blue
Viennese band, and White Viennese band.

I do know that he played around the Folkestone area, possibly with his own
band, Herr Willem Wendels Original (or Famous) Viennese Orchestra. This
would have been in the period leading up to 1913. For a short time, possibly
between 1911 and 1913, he played on the transatlantic liners.

I have various photos of him in bands, and on his own, including a photo of
a band that I can't identify, but looks as if it was taken on the veranda of
a building, possibly on the south coast. I also have a photo of my great
grandmother, possibly about the time that she was working in the 'guest
house'.

My grandfather's sister was scarred when she fell into the fireplace of the
'guest house' where they lived with their mother. I have just read of the
huge fireplace in Abbots Fireside, Elham, a very old hotel / Inn/ guest
house which would have been around when my great grandmother was in charge.
Could this place, Abbots Fireside, have been where she worked, and where she
met my great grandfather?

Do you know of a good way that I could follow this up?

I look forward to hearing from you.
