Bit of a tongue in cheek story <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,2177276,00.html">here in the Guardian</a> about the launch of <a href="/wiki/folkestone+triennial">folkestone triennial</a> (is that an art festival every three years?). Particularly hilarious is their attempt to compare Folkestone with Venice towards the end of the article... I recommend ignoring the intro which starts:

<blockquote>To many Folkestone is nothing but the unprepossessing place one once passed through in order to take a ferry to somewhere more glamorous.</blockquote>

and let's concentrate more on things like 

<blockquote>... plans to transform Folkestone into a prosperous hub of arts and culture are under way. Yesterday the inaugural Folkestone triennial was announced, a public art project to involve commissions by a blue-chip line-up of artists including <a href="/wiki/tracey+emin">Tracey Emin</a>, <a href="/wiki/mark+wallinger">Mark Wallinger</a>, <a href="/wiki/nathan+coley">Nathan Coley</a>, <a href="/wiki/tacita+dean+">Tacita Dean,</a> <a href="/wiki/richard+wentworth">Richard Wentworth</a> and <a href="/wiki/richard+wilson">Richard Wilson</a> from Britain, and international figures such as <a href="/wiki/mark+dion">Mark Dion</a> and <a href="/wiki/christian+boltanski">Christian Boltanski</a>.</blockquote>

<a href="/wiki/richard+wilson">Richard Wilson</a>? I don't believe it... and who on earth is ex <a href="/wiki/iron+maiden">Iron Maiden</a> drummer <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=thunderstick">Thunderstick</a>?
