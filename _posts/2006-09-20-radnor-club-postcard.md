Someone sold <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/RADNOR-CLUB-CHRISTCHURCH-FOLKESTONE-KENT_W0QQitemZ6284380537QQcategoryZ63813QQcmdZViewItem">a postcard here</a> of <a href="/wiki/radnor+club">The Radnor Club</a>, for 22 recently. Unfortunately the picture of isn't loading...

<blockquote>RADNOR CLUB, CHRISTCHURCH, FOLKESTONE. KENT

Postally used 1913.  Real photo Radnor club, Christchurch, Folkestone, Kent, minor corner creasing. Nice card.</blockquote>

Does that mean "Christchurch Road" do you think? That's where <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1701/The%20Happy%20Frenchman">The Happy Frenchman</a> is now, so was that <a href="/wiki/radnor+club">The Radnor Club</a>? Or was it at the end of the road, on the corner, where that building is up for sale right now?
