Folkestone poet Ben Barton has made the Amazon UK's Top 5 'Hot Books' chart with his debut poetry collection...

Called THE RED BOOK, it is described as his greatest hits collection featuring over forty previously published poems, from The Re-Birth Remembered, a poem which won the Folkestone Ottakars Bookshop Poetry Competition in 1998, to more recent work based on Derek Jarmans garden at Dungeness. Others include the widely-published The Dark Cloud of Dover and poems written from his apartment in the Metropole.
