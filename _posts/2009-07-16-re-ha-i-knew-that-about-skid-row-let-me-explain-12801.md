Cheers P! 3 times eeewwwww, once is unforgivable but thrice! 

I got to meet Gary (nicked his guitar strap - well the one he was wearing, not his personal one you know, just perchance it would magic up my guitar playing...)! 

I got to know Brendan (I bet you didn't know he was voted bassist of the year in the <a href="/wiki/nme">NME</a> in [year]1971[/year]ish)? Great guy. <a href="/wiki/skid+row">Skid Row</a> were hot as hell, we used see them at the old <a href="/wiki/marquee">Marquee</a> any time they were playing - happy days...

Btw, I played in Folkestone circa [year]1970[/year]/[year=1971]71[/year] in a band called '<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=rockin+pneumonia">Rockin Pneumonia</a>', yer really, I dunno what venue, nor I bet anyone remembers us? ah well
