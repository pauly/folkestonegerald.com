Glad we made the effort to visit this place, after reading about it in <a href="/wiki/more+tales+from+the+tap+room">More Tales from the Tap Room</a>, it's a great pub. Bit of a walk from Folkestone, being just past the <a href="/wiki/sandgate+hotel">Sandgate Hotel</a>, but worth the effort. It's quite a small <a href="/wiki/shepherd+neame">Shepherd Neame</a> pub, but cosy and friendly. Had four ales on (Best, Spitfire, Porter and something else) for me, and a good range of chocolate behind the bar that pleased Clare. Didn't investigate the menu properly, though it seems there was at least one vege option.

No pool table or music even, but they did have dominoes, which we played and played. Dominoes is the new darts, you'll all be into it soon.

Definitely going to visit again, and looking forward to trying it in the summer, when it's location and outside tables will really come into their own.
