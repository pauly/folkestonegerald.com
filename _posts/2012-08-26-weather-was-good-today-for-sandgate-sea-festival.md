I should have posted the link to <a href="http://www.sandgate-sea-festival.co.uk">sandgate-sea-festival.co.uk</a> and reminded people it was on in advance shouldn't I? The 'Gerald is going down hill... Anyway just been along there, very busy, nice to see so many people in Sandgate. <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> and new addition <a href="/wiki/sixty+six">The Sixty Six</a> were both doing food.
