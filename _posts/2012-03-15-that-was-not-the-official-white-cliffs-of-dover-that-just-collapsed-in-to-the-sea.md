It happened days ago, not sure why the papers just got it today. It's not part of the land that is the official <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/home/item281133/">National Trust</a> property, apparently the bit that collapsed in to the sea is some private land, part of a farm. Interesting though.
