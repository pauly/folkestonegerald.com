We did the <a href="/wiki/quiz">quiz</a> at <a href="/wiki/britannia">The Britannia</a> this week, my first time though the wife has been the previous three weeks. A good fun quiz, apparently the food is very good too. Next week I'll be there early for the eats too as it is <a href="/wiki/curry+night">curry night</a>.

We came second, thought we were more soundly beaten than that. A spider is not an insect though, tut tut.
