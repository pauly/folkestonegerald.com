Next stop on our <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/16594/We+went+to+some+new+pubs+%231+The+Black+Horse">trying some new pubs</a> night out, <a href="/wiki/duke+of+cumberland">The Duke Of Cumberland</a> in <a href="/wiki/barham">Barham</a>. Again a bit further afield than we would normally travel, but we'll definitely be going back to this one in the daytime, as they have a GREAT kids play area. The pub itself was nice, though seemed warmer and friendlier in the dining area than in the bar where we sat. Looking forward to taking the boy back here for an afternoon of him climbing crazy on the play area while I try one of the <a href="/wiki/real+ale">real ale</a>s.

There is a connection with <a href="/wiki/jackdaw">The Jackdaw</a> in Denton, for more info see <a href="http://www.dukeofcumberland.co.uk">dukeofcumberland.co.uk</a>.
