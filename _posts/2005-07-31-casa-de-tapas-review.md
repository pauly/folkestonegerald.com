Had a great Tapas meal last night in Sandgate, lots of exciting dishes for the omnivores and plent of vege options for me. The spicy potatoes were particularly good. Washed down with several bottles of Cava, it made for a great evening. This was our first visit since it had reopened, but we will be returning soon.
