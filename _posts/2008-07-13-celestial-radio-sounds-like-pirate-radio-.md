celestial radio: a visionary journey

on saturday 19th july artists zo walker and neil bromwick will sail into folkestone harbour aboard <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorboogie/2639618670/">their magnificent mirror tiled yatch, the celeste</a>.  adorned with over 60,000 one inch mirror tiles, the celeste is the base for the artists' unique project, celeste radio.  broadcasting on 87.7fm, the artists have created a special soundpiece for their tour around the kent coast that features music from the heyday of the pirate radio era combined with interviews with people from kent discussing famous visionaries associated with the area such as <a href="/wiki/jmw+turner">JMW Turner</a>, [abe]TS Eliot[/abe], [abe]Pugin[/abe] and [abe]HG Wells[/abe].  radios and headsets will be available on the day for people to listen to the broadcast or you can tune in at home or in your car.
