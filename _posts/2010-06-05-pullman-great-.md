On our journey from holidays in the Cotswolds back to Germany, we spent a last evening on the island in Folkestone, in The Pullman. It was the happy end of two wonderful weeks!

The owner was very kind and obliging, for instance to show us the way to a cash machine. The staff was very polite and open-minded to let us select the right meal and drink. (Best regards to the girl with relatives at Bielefeld!) The whole atmosphere was plesant even to strangers like us. Thanks!
