<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2374571.ece">The Sun has pictures</a> from the house party / house trashing that was on the cover of The Herald (or was it one of the free papers) last week - some BAD tenants seem to have smashed up their rental property in Folkestone, owned by Carolyn Lorimer.

The Sun are looking for people who were at the party, or friends of the tenants - there might be some money in it for you if you contact them...
