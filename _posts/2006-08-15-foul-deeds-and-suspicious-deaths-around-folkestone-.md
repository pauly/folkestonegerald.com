No not a headline from the Herald, but <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845630114/">a new book by Martin Easdown and Linda Sage</a>, sounds great! I think it's new anyway, and not yet actually published...

<blockquote><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845630114/"> Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths Around Folkestone</a> takes the reader on a sinister journey through the annals of crime in Folkestone, Hythe and the surrounding area. Along the way we meet villains, murderers and victims of many kinds, including cut-throat soldiers, a "baby farmer", a <a href="/wiki/jack+the+ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> imposter, two inexplicable suicides and five individuals who died violent deaths in the "House of Horror". There is no shortage of harrowing and revealing incidents of evil to recount, many of which will be unfamiliar to the reader. Infant murders were once so rife in Folkestone it was termed the "infanticide capital of Kent'". This fascinating book recalls many such grisly events, as well as sad or unsavoury individuals who have darkened this otherwise plasant corner of the Garden of England.</blockquote>
