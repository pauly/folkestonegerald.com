Heard a rumour that <a href="/wiki/bar+vasa">Bar Vasa</a> were going to be opening a new place along <a href="/wiki/tontine+street">Tontine Street</a> soon, but now, they are going to be running the bar at the new <a href="/wiki/quarterhouse">Quarterhouse</a> venue. I expect you have picked up this news somewhere else already, but just trying something new.
