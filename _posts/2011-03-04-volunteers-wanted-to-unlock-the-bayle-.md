<blockquote>Dear volunteers,

As you know we have two weekends of archaeology on <a href="/wiki/bayle">The Bayle</a> coming up on 12th/13th and 19th/20th March - "Unlocking the Bayle".  We hope to uncover some of the fascinating history of the site which stretches from the <a href="/wiki/neolithic">Neolithic</a> to the <a href="/wiki/medieval">Medieval</a>.

We are looking for 15 volunteers to take part in these weekends.  If you would be interested please let us know by 5pm next Tuesday 8th March by writing to townunearthed@canterbury.ac.uk.  We will respond to you on a first come first served basis.  Volunteers will be fully briefed.

If you have not had a look already, may I take this opportunity to remind you that the ATU community website is now live.  Visit it  at <a href="http://www.atownunearthed.co.uk">atownunearthed.co.uk</a> and let us know what you think.  Feedback and
suggestions are very welcomed.

Kind regards,

Hannah
