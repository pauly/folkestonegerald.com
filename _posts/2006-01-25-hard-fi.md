I love Hard Fi but I'm sure my neighbours hate me.  I'm 43 of Afro Carib descent and have been playing the CD non stop ever since I got it (might even get served with an ASBO).  I've got to say though I never really noticed the CCTV signs before until I bought the CD and as I work in the IP section of a law firm (legal jargon for copyrights, patents etc) I hope the guys have sorted out who owns the sign and got permission for using it!!!!  If not then they can come here and I'm sure the firm will be happy to represent them (well I would anyway)!!!!
