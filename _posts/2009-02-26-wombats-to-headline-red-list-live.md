Of course, why didn't I think of them when I was after animal named bands to headline this zoo festival? Apart from them being indie no marks I mean, who an old giffer like me would not have called a headliner.

<blockquote>We are very happy to announce <a href="/wiki/wombats">The Wombats</a> as our first headliner. The lovely Liverpudlians will be heading to Kent!  With their recent huge success and having won "Best Dancefloor Filler" for their single <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lets-Dance-Joy-Division-Wombats/dp/B000UEY3N6/">Let's Dance To Joy Division</a> at the Shockwaves NME Awards 2008, we thought they would be the perfect act to be one of our main stage headliners.</blockquote>
