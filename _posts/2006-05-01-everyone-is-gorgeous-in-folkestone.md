I don't see the point in paying to go to a place like that, now that everything is open later. I reckon <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> is your best bet, though it depends on what night it is, what DJ's are there etc. <a href="/wiki/pipers">Pipers</a> is proper rough and ready, and I suppose <a href="/wiki/indigo">Indigo</a> is the one for the young person's dance music. It's the biggest and most modern club.
