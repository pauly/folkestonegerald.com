i went to cafe belge canterbury with my parter in april and recieved a very good service i read the comment from the vegiterian couple and think maybie they should go to a green grocers for lunch?
its very hard i think for restaurants to satisfy everybodys needs perhaps they should accknowledge this?
i have never had a problem with cafe belge i love the beers and am trying to try all the 100 different ones.the mussels are great and id eat there every week if i had one close to me as i live in london.
thank you cafe belge
