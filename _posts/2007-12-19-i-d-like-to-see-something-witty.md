Um, I can't think what though.

Whatever happened to <a href="http://www.strangecargo.org.uk/newsroom/news.jsp?news=40" title="Strange Cargo art project">other people's photographs</a>, I thought they were meant to be on display at <a href="/wiki/bouverie+place">Bouverie Place</a>. They used one of my pictures, but no sign of it so far...
