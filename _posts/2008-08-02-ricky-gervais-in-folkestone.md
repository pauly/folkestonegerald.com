I think this is at the Battle of Britain memorial in <a href="/wiki/capel">Capel</a>. One of the sketches for <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=11+o+clock+show">The 11 O'Clock Show</a> that <a href="http://www.rickygervais.com/starticle.php">he regrets not doing under a character name like Billy Bigot</a> I assume.

<blockquote>In Politics, Gervais's teenage enthusiasm for activism kicks off a series of digs at liberal sacred cows - from accusing the disabled of being lazy to mocking anti-war songs and sloganeering T-shirts. Could it ruffle feathers? "I think that most people know it's a persona," he says. "I don't really think the disabled are lazy, but I like walking that line. I could give the character a name - like Billy Bigot - but that's not interesting.</blockquote>
