<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=folkestone&ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=51.079135,1.181931&spn=0.003842,0.013025&t=h&om=1">Church Street</a> is in the old part of Folkestone, by St Eanswythe's church, I would guess the building is likely to be still there, though that might be where <a href="http://www.steanswythesschool.org.uk/">the primary school</a> is now. When I get a chance I'll go down there and have a look, maybe take a picture.

It get's a mention (according to <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~folkestonefamilies/mackie.htm this great index]]" title="Mackie's book about Folkestone">in [[Mackie</a>, if you can [abe=mackie folkestone neighbourhood]track down a copy[/abe].
