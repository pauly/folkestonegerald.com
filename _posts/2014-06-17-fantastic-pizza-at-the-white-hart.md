Went for a <a href="/wiki/pizza">pizza</a> evening at the <a href="/wiki/white+hart">White Hart</a> in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a>, a friend is trying out as a chef, a career change. He's ace at food, so it's great he is following his dream. Even better, he is sharing his skills, and better still he made some <a href="/wiki/vegan">vegan</a> pizzas too. I heartily recommend the <a href="/wiki/white+hart">White Hart</a>, go there and try the <a href="/wiki/pizza">pizza</a>.
