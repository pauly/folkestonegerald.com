<a href="http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/news.php?id=259&u=index.php">Read about it here</a> on <a href="http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk">southeasternrailway.co.uk</a>.

See the actual <a href="http://www.southeastern2009.co.uk/index.php/cms/pages/view/261">high speed draft timetable</a>, including high speed rail link between Folkestone and London Kings Cross St Pancras - looks like 57 minutes from Folkestone Central if you catch the direct train or 56 minutes with a change if I'm reading this right. Not much good with timetables.

The timetable does include services direct from Folkestone West and Dover to London Kings Cross too. Another service runs from Canterbury West to London Kings Cross St Pancras in one hour too.

Sounds good, it's only the draft though, I expect these times will be lengthened to fit in potential delays...
