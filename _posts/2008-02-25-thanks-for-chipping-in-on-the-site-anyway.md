Not been to many gigs in this area myself, only <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> and <a href="/wiki/dirty+pretty+things">Dirty Pretty Things</a> I think, few more in <a href="/wiki/tunbridge+wells">Tunbridge Wells</a> back in the day and <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/misc/gigography/">squillions in London and Hampshire</a>.
