only Sainsbury Park Farm and Morrisons spring to mind, [s]but I expect there are also in the car park of ASDA in the town centre[s] Definitely NO FACILITIES at the Sainsbury or ASDA in the town when I asked recently, sorry.

Do you not have a doorstep collection of recycling on Sandgate Road then? I thought everywhere in the town did.
