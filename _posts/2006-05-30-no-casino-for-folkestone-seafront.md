<a href="http://www.shepway.gov.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1069&Itemid=449">Shepway.gov.uk has the full story</a>:

<blockquote>Shepway District Council has been notified by the Casino Advisory Panel that their proposal to allow a casino at Folkestone Seafront has been unsuccessful.

Shepway Cabinet member for regeneration Cllr Linda Cufley said: "We are very disappointed with the news.  It could have helped in regenerating and revitalizing the town but we were up against some stiff competition."</blockquote>
