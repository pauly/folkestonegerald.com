I am astounded at the above comment.  We are regular diers at Bella Pizza & Pasta and we have never ever recieved poor service.  The waiting staff are extremely attentive, the food is superb, and the general atmosphere is one of happy diners.  I would give Bella Pizza & Pasta a 10/10!  In addition to all of the above the prices are VERY reasonable :)
