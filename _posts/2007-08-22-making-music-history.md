We are attempting to create a World Record for the most recorded versions of one song - a single symphony - All We Need Is Love 

The website is set up, the charity - Children In Need - is in place and the top ten downloads will be released on the first ever Concept Single - All We Need Is Love 

We are approaching communities to encourage them to participate. It's great fun, It's for charity, it will make a new world record and it could make stars - it is participation - not competition andcompletely free!
