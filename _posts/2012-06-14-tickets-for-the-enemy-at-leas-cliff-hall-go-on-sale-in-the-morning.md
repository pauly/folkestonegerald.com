<blockquote>We are pleased to announce that <a href="/wiki/enemy">The Enemy</a> will be returning to the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a> with their new tour!

<a href="/wiki/streets+in+the+sky">Streets in the Sky</a> is the band's third album and according to the band, their best yet. The new top 10 album has the signature Enemy anthemic guitar sound yet it is much heavier than the last two albums.</blockquote>

like the band are going to say "yeah, it's not as good as our last album actually"...
