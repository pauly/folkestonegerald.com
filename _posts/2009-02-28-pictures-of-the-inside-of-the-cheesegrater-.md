<a href="http://www.archdaily.com/15548/quarterhouse-performing-arts-and-business-centre-in-folkestone/">Here on archdaily.com</a>. CMS Secretary of State <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=andy+burnham">Andy Burnham</a>, performs the official opening of our new venue on the 5th of March. Where's my invite? Big ups to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/4086/Number+11">Number 11</a> (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_Downing_Street">that one</a>), who did invite me to their opening do on Thursday. Sorry <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/gig/The-Cure-NME-Big-Gig-O2-Arena/35277.html">I couldn't make it</a>.

<blockquote>The building is the centrepiece of the city's arts-led regeneration programme spearheaded by client <a href="/wiki/creative+foundation">The Creative Foundation</a>. The 1550 sqm includes a 220 seat, 500 standing multi-purpose auditorium for music, dance, theatre, film performances and conferences; ground floor foyer and exhibition space; first floor cafe / bar and a top floor business centre for start-ups in the creative industries.</blockquote>

They even make <a href="/wiki/tontine+street">Tontine Street</a> look quite vibrant in the pictures too!
