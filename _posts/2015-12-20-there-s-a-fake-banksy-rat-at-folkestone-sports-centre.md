It's inside, so authorised by the sports centre, and signed by <a href="/wiki/robski">ROBSKI</a>, a nice clear copy of a <a href="/wiki/banksy">Banksy</a> rat, holding a paintbrush.

I was there at 7am today signing up for <a href="/wiki/harry">Harry</a>'s <a href="/wiki/gymnastics">gymnastics</a> class. Great love hath no Dad on a Sunday morning...
