New dates for our charity boot fairs in Folkestone for 2008 have just been announced, with the next boot fair being held on <b>Saturday 3rd May</b>.

Due to a potential change in use of the Shorncliffe Road field, it was initially thought that we would not be able to hold any boot fairs this year. But the owners of the field have now allowed us to hold fairs until the end of July 2008. The full dates are therefore:

[i]Saturday 3rd May
Saturday 17th May
Saturday 31st May
Saturday 14th June
Saturday 28th June
Saturday 12th July
Saturday 26th July[/i]

All fairs start at 7.00am and any changes to these dates will be posted on our website, <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.westbrookparents.org">westbrookparents.org</a>.

Thanks!
