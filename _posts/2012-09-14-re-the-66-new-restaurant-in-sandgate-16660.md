I read some of these reviews yesterday and was slightly worried as my partner had booked a table for us last night.

I needn't of worried - it was FAB!

Most businesses have teething problems and this place has only been open a couple of months. I understand it is expensive and in an ideal world it would be perfect from the start however, is that very realistic? Maybe it is because I run my own business and so I am more tolerant to how things can go wrong in the beginning.

The young lady serving us was polite,friendly and more than efficient.

I had the scallop starter and they were cooked to perfection. They literally melted in my mouth - divine!

My partner and I both had the fillet steak (medium) and it was cooked to perfection. I often despair at how frequently I have been served over-cooked steak (in other places) but last night's lump of cow was PERFECT!

I had the sweet potato wedges and my partner had the thrice cooked chips. 

We have been to Heston's restaurant in London and my other half preferred the chips at The Sixty Six! Not at ALL soggy, very nice indeed! If I had to nit-pick I would say that the sweet potatoes didn't need salt but then that is because I like the sweetness of them as they come - this is just my own personal taste!

We shared a chocolate/ginger pudding with custard and OMG it was HEAVENLY!! The balance of ginger was perfect (I was worried it might be overwhelming) and I ate it until I felt stuffed.

Was it cheap? No, it wasn't BUT I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for and we were delighted. 

We will be back!
