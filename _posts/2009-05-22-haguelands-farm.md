my friend and I loved our first  visit to haguelands farm.Friendly staff, good food.

second vist not quite so goosd, my bread roll was still frozen in the mo#iddle.

The last visit however has crossed the venue off our list. We arrived just after 10 a.m. A table was set for a party and preparations were underway. we were ignored for at least 10 minutes ( a simple acknowledgement would have helped.)

My friend went to the toilet. The toilet bowl was stained and there was a single (dirty) towel.

We had intended to eat. we drank our tea and left.

We will not be back
