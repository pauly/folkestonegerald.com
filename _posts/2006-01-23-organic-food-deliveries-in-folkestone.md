Got a brocher through the door from <a href="http://www.abel-cole.co.uk">Abel Cole</a>, a mixed box of organic veg for a tenner a week, sound like a good deal..?

This week's box will contain;

Apples In Conversion
Blood Oranges
Broccoli
Carrots
Fennel
Jerusalem Artichoke
Kiwi Fruit
Potatoes

with all items available for exchange... so what's "in conversion"? In the process of converting to mouldy apples? No it's soil association approved supplier, but not quite actually organic. You can vote for what kind of stuff you like, this sounds great and we're going to give them a go... will report back as to how we got on.
