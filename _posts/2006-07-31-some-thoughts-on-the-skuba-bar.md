Slight repost from the weblog:
<blockquote>... got distracted by the thought of Thai food in Skuba. It was GREAT to sit out in their garden when we should have been at work, reading the papers while waiting for our lunch to arrive - this is the life I was thinking, I could do this every day, is there a way to make it pay? 

The food itself wasn't the best, the vegetables in my red curry seemed tinned, and there wasn't any great heat to it either, bah. Nice enough though and I think if I go for a different dish next time it might be better. The location and atmosphere (helped along by what a lovely day it was) just about compensated for the lunch...</blockquote>
