<blockquote>Hi
 
I have just been looking at the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2/Leas+Cliff+Hall/history">Leas Cliff Hall archive gig list</a> and could not see a mention of a date that I gigged there. I played drums in a little known band called Scruff supporting <a href="/wiki/japan">Japan</a> and then <a href="/wiki/jim+capaldi">Jim Capaldi</a>, all on the same night. Not sure of the date but it would be [year]1977[/year],[year=1978]78[/year] or [year=1979]79[/year] possibly [year=1980]80[/year]. Oh, and we also supported a Dutch band called Boozie during the same period.
 
I would imagine you are a busy people, but if you could find any details of these gigs.... well, I'd be over the moon.
 
Kind Regards
