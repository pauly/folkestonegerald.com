do you have live bands on fridays or saturday if so we could put you onto a very good local band they play at the park inn, happy frenchman, the castle, the firs club, all over Deal, Dover, Ashford, and Margate. They ahve recorded a CD which you can have to listen to if you wish. But can assure you they bring a crowd where ever they go and you would not be dissapointed ask any pubs I have mentioned.  Thank you for your time
