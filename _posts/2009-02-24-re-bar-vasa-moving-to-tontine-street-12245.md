Paul,

I responded on Twitter before reading the above linked post. Mmmmmm, I wonder if this is the start of a mini-empire. I remember years ago (early 1990's) when Panchos was really going well in Hythe and Jerry and Melvin (the owners) also opened up in Canterbury. It wasn't a great success and the original Panchos seemed to suffer for it. We'll see...

In the meantime we're looking forward to getting back down to Bar Vasa this Easter to work our way through the Meze and a couple of bottles of wine. 

Regards,
Colin
