If anyone out there can offer any more info along these lines about any of the venues here, that'll really help with <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/">the map</a>; accomodation, booze, real ale, children welcome, dartboard, dj, food, garden, jukebox, live music, pool table, vegetarian food, wifi access... some of those choices might seem a bit odd, but it's what I want to know about a place! If there are any new things that should be added, leave a message here or <a href="/wiki/mailto+fg+folkestonegerald+com+drop+me+a+line">mailto:fg@folkestonegerald.com drop me a line</a>. Think I'll have a go at a few new topical features - opening hours and whether or not smoking is allowed.
