Heard there was a new bar in town, <a href="/wiki/impressions">Impressions</a>, and so there is, it's at 33 Tontine Street, opposite Pipers, where a curry house used to be. It is a bar bistro, and looks like it's open daytimes too, though we didn't go in until the evening. Got there about 8.30 or 9pm maybe, and though the sign says open it was hard to be sure. It's a very bright bar, far too bright, need to dim those lights down a lot. It's still mostly laid out as a curry house would be, with little booth type tables to the rear, but with a more open bar area to the front. Not a lot in the way of draft beer, they're obviously not aiming at that market, just Amstel and some other lager at 2.70 a pint.

We were the only customers in the place for the whole time (one pint) that we were there, and now I'm starting to think that it wasn't really open at all, and the staff were just too polite to tell us. One member of staff was sat in the middle of the floor scrubbing like Lady Macbeth at some imagined spot. This was weird, but if the bar wasn't really open, then it was OK. Located where it is I'd have thought it's a bit of a club feeder type bar (a bar that people go to before heading to the nearby clubs I mean, not a bar where people go to feed each other), and we probably won't go again, but if you go to Impressions, please report back on how it was!
