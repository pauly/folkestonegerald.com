I am a PROFESSIONAL solo singer guitarist and was booked MONTHS back to play at the Neptune Inn on 31st July 08. I phoned today to confirm and the guy there was stroppy and rude, saying I would not go down there as they never have solos. I offered a duo act (with a fellow muso) but he offrerd me silly money. As far as I am concerned, whoever he was, he is  rude and un-business like, and gives the venue a bad image. I wouldn't play there now if they offered me 500!!
