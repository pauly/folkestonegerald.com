<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.beerintheevening.com">Beer in the Evening</a> have made some changes to their site, you can search for a pub by all sorts of things now, including customer comments... I can't remember all the details, I deleted the mail now, but go there, and have a look...

There's a good list of <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone pubs</a> there, but some of the ratings are a bit off... how is <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> not the highest scoring pub on their list?
