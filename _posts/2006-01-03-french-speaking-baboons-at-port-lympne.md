According to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4566526.stm">BBC's 100 things we didn't know this time last year</a>, zoo keepers at <a href="/wiki/port+lympne">Port Lympne</a> wild animal park in Kent are having to learn French to communicate with the baboons which had been raised in French zoos. The same feature also teaches us that <a href="/wiki/anthony+worrell+thompson">Anthony Worrell Thompson</a> has swum The Channel.
