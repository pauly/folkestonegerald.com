Or rather [artists]Peter Doherty[/artist] as he would like to be know now. Enjoy if you're going, hope he turns up.

Tonight I am at the <a href="/wiki/goldie+lookin+chain">Goldie Lookin' Chain</a> in <a href="/wiki/exeter">Exeter</a>! I was quite a fan, but I'm not following them around the country or anything, it's a friend's birthday, and he's moved down that way.
