No probably not, but surely we should be looking to attract new people to the festival if we want it to continue to be a success.
People regularly move to and from Folkestone which means our demographic is always changing and it would be wrong to think that everyone is just interested in fighting and not enjoying the good things our town has to offer. 
The number of people who attend the festival grows each year and we hope the new name will attract all those who enjoy books and reading, whether it be a light-hearted piece of chick lit or a much-loved English classic.
