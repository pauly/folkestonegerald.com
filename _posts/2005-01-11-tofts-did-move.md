from <a href="/wiki/bouverie+road+west">Bouverie Road West</a> to <a href="/wiki/grace+hill">Grace Hill</a> I believe, though it may also have changed it's name when it moved to <a href="/wiki/grace+hill">Grace Hill</a>. Equally importantly though, I might have got that venue wrong, any idea of the name of the venue in <a href="/wiki/tontine+street">Tontine Street</a>?  This is all before my time, I have cribbed this together from other websites. If you have any info you can send me, I'd really appreciate it, fg@folkestonegerald.com

The comments you've left so far will be saved on the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/1967/">Folkestone 1967</a> page, hopefully they'll stir someone elses memory...

Did you see <a href="/wiki/jimi+hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>?
