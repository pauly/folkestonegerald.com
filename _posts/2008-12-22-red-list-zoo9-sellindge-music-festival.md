An anti-press release from <a href="/wiki/sellindge+music+festival">Sellindge Music Festival</a>! Probably best to get some bands on board and send out some info about who is playing your festival, rather than just going on about someone else's festival. Good to point this out though, <a href="/wiki/zoo8">Zoo8</a> was a disaster <b>IN MY OPINION</b>. And you wouldn't want to get caught out accidentally buying tickets for zoo9 would you? Here's what they have to say:

<i><a href="/wiki/red+list+live">Red List Live</a> asked me to remove all of the <a href="/wiki/sellindge+festival">Sellindge Festival</a> press release.</i>

<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.redlistlive.com">The official red list live site</a> says the new festival is all about raising money for the Aspinal Foundation, no mention of it being the new name for, or organised by the same people as <a href="/wiki/zoo+thousand">Zoo Thousand</a>.
