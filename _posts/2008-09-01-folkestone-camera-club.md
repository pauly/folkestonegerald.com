Folkestone Camera Club starts it's new season on Monday 1st September with a Welcome Evening for any potential new members coming along.

There will be several displays showing our work and explaining what we do each week and at our monthly practical evenings which covers studio work, photoshop, audio visual etc.  We do hope to see some new faces as well as familiar ones.

We have approximately 100 members now and are one of the largest clubs in Kent.

Some additional news:- recently there has been a Costa Coffee Folkestone Triennial Photography Competition in which two of our members Paul Mellier and Jan McKay respectively came first and second, so well done and congratulations to you both.

We are also holding our Annual Exhibition of Prints on Saturday 13th September from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the University Centre, Mill Bay (The Glassworks), Folkestone, which will be incorporated with the University Open Day.

Our meetings are held at the St. Georges Church, Audley Road, (on the corner of Shorncliffe Road, opposite West Station), Folkestone every Monday September to May commencing at 7.45 p.m.  Any enquiries phone 01303 245399 or visit our website <a href="http://www.folkestonecameraclub.co.uk">folkestonecameraclub.co.uk</a>
