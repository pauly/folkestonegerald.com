Also went to Earl Brownes in Hythe yesterday, it's new, and it's quite swanky... an interesting mix of styles, from the tudor beams in the bar, back to the bedouin style drapes at the back. A bit bright in there, but very nice. No real ales, but they do have Bitberger on tap. Menu looks nice, a bit of a mediteranian style mix, some of it feels French or Italian, but then they have fajita style dishes too. Only been open three days, go and have a look...
