ALEX HORNE (we had alex booked for the literary festival gig last september, but he cancelled because he was filming the wkd adverts which are currently on tv!  we spoke to him on tuesday and he was still on then so hopefully it's all go for saturday!  he tells amazingly constructed jokes with a brilliant underlining of silliness, wait for some great wordplay and fun audience participation!  "a quick witted and genial comedian" - THE INDEPENDENT)

MERYL O'ROURKE (i haven't seen meryl before, but have heard she's really good.  her cv boasts a friendly demeanour and various radio 4 writing credits so what can go wrong?!?  "a well-spoken but confessedly insecure thirtysomething who chats easily and openly to her audience" - CHORTLE)

JIM GRANT (filling the open spot for the evening, jim is a great act based in eastbourne who comperes several of his own gigs in that region.  not really an open spot comedian then?  he's great!)

MC DAVE WARD (picking up the baton is our second resident compere, known as one of the greatest in the country.  the number of times we've requested him back, it seems we agree!)
