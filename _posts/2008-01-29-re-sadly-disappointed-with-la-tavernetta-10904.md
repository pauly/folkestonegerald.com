I agree we went there Friday 25th January 2008 the wine wine was good and that was the best part of the meal.Old fashioned and over priced springs to mind with over rated food,my wife was nearly in tears as it was are 15th wedding aniversary and a treat for us to go out.We also have children and i wish we had stayed at home.
