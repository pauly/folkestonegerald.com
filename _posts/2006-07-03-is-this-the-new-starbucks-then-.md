I've not read <a href="/wiki/herald">The Herald</a> this week, so sorry if this has already been established. I took this picture last weekend on the way back from the pub, and then the next day had NO IDEA where it was or why I'd taken it.

Possibly it's the old <a href="/wiki/marks+and+spencer">Marks and Spencer</a>, which I hear will be the new Starbucks, does that sound right? The venue's a bit of a whopper, are they going to divide it up?

It was meant to be opening in July...
