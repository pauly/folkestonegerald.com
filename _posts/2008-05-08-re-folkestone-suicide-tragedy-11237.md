<a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> has named the woman as Rosie Dunstall, she'd recently suffered from depression, and was reportedly at Wilkinsons discussing a possible return to work before the tragedy. Makes more sense than my previous imaginings about someone planning to end it all but wanting to get some work out of the way first.
