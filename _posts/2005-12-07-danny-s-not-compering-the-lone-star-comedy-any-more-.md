DANNY JAMES makes his last appearance as resident compere at the <a href="http://www.lonestarcomedy.co.uk">Lone Star Comedy Club</a> for the final show of the year on Saturday December 17th when the acts are <a href="/wiki/reginald+d+hunter">REGINALD D. HUNTER</a>, <a href="/wiki/george+egg">GEORGE EGG</a> and <a href="/wiki/neil+mooney">NEIL MOONEY</a>.

DANNY JAMES offers an explosive mix of well-constructed comedy scenarios and utter daftness. Engaging and candid, loveable and self destructive, sharp and blunt  theres something for everyone, deliciously wrapped in chocolate and served with prawns. He took his first one-man show to Edinburgh Festival in 2005 with Radio Blah Blah.

DANNY JAMES has been the popular compere since the club opened in January 2004 but after two years feels that it is time to pursue other avenues. A new resident compere will be in place for the next show on Saturday January 21st.

REGINALD D. HUNTER makes a return appearance at the club (having first appeared in November 2004) and in little over a year has established himself as one of the most sought after headline comics in the UK.

GEORGE EGG is an accomplished stand-up and visual comedian, armed with a giant oversized briefcase, and a battery of props, which when combined with surreal stories and hilarious observations provides an unrivalled comic experience.

Tickets are 8 each or 64 for a table of eight on the main dance floor area. Call Richard on 07810 864228 to book your place. Doors open at 8pm, with the show starting at 8.30pm.
