Tonight's <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/come-dine-with-me/episode-guide/series-26/episode-10">Come Dine With Me</a> was the episode recently filmed in Folkestone and Dover, so looking forward to that:

<blockquote> Four cooks from Folkestone and Dover engage in a week of competitive dining. Taking part are eccentric 70-year-old <a href="/wiki/janet+cripps">Janet Cripps</a>, self-confessed witch <a href="/wiki/lisa+mansfield">Lisa Mansfield</a>, parish priest <a href="/wiki/andy+bawtree">Andy Bawtree</a> and businessman <a href="/wiki/john+george">John George</a>.

Between them the quartet of hopeful hosts come up with a 50s night, some saucy talk and physical exchanges over dessert, a Downton Abbey dress code, an Abba tribute band, and a cowboy song.</blockquote>

I hear there is some bad behaviour, what a shocker!
