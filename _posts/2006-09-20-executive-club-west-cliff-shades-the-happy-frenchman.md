<a href="http://www.steffonline.co.uk/Copyshades/History.htm">This history of West Cliff Shades</a>, which seems to have been turned into <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1701/The+Happy+Frenchman">The Happy Frenchman</a>, and from the description that goes with their picture (which must be quoted from the original picture source) seems to indicate that <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1701/The+Happy+Frenchman">The Happy Frenchman</a> [em]is[/em] "The Executive Club" / "The Radnor Club". What do you think?

<a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1701/The+Happy+Frenchman">The Frenchman</a> is currently closed "for the forseeable future" because of a fire, it's undergoing a big refitting, I am not expecting it to reopen as the same kind of pub.
