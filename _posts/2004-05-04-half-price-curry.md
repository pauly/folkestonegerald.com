A recommendation for curry in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>, get along to the <a href="/wiki/new+delhi">New Delhi</a> on the first Sunday of the month. We did this week, everything was half price, and their prices are reasonable to start with.

They seem to specialise in the hotter end of the curry spectrum, beloved of people like us after a full day on the beer. I nearly managed to finish my vegetable vindaloo, but not quite.
