On the same day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_30th">March 30th</a> (though maybe a few years apart), <a href="/wiki/thomas+cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a> became archbishop of <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a>, and <a href="/wiki/ramones">The Ramones</a> played their first ever gig.

Still not found when they played <a href="/wiki/canterbury+odeon">Canterbury Odeon</a>.
