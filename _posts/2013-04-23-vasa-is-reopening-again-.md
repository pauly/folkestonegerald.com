The exclamation mark there is more one of "I can't believe I'm repeating the same old thing again" rather than any genuine excitement, I don't really go in there. <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a>'s <a href="/wiki/bar+vasa">Bar Vasa</a> (sometimes just called <a href="/wiki/vasa">Vasa</a>) has a big banner outside saying "under new management" and they're hiring again. I don't know who has bought it, but I'd like to think it's just the first sniff of sunny weather has made it spring back to life again.
