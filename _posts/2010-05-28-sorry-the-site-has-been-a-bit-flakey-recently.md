I've been crippling the server this runs on. Well you have really, there are too many of you, the site is too popular. I had some inefficient database stuff going on, which was causing problems, but hopefully that is fixed now.
Thanks for sticking with me!
The hosts are <a href="http://www.uksolutions.co.uk">uksolutions.co.uk</a> I have been with them for BLIMEY over ten years now, thanks to them for being patient with me and thanks to other sites that are on the same box and better behaved than I am. Like <a href="http://thequietus.com">thequietus.com</a> I'm sure we share a server...
