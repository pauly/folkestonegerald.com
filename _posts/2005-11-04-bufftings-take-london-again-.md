Folkestone's own <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebufftings">The Bufftings</a> play <a href="/wiki/kings+cross+water+rats">Kings Cross Water Rats</a> tomorrow (Saturday 5th November), and I only just found out. This means it will be quieter in <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a>...

Anyone got any advice for where to go for a bonfire?
