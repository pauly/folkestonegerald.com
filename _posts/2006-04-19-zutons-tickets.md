Heard on <a href="http://www.onfolkestone.co.uk]]" title="From Wayahead / Seetickets / Gigs and tours / whoever they are">that the gig's sold out - IT'S NOT, [[http://www.wayahead.com/livegigpopex/price.asp?filler1=livegigpopex&code=178722 get Zutons tickets here</a>. The gig's on the 25th of May.

In case this causes a run on the final batch of tickets, and it really is sold out when you read this <a href="http://search.ebay.co.uk/Zutons%20tickets" title="Click here to search for Zutons tickets">give ebay a try</a>, prices are not high right now (well, it's not sold out) but nearer the time they're sure to go up...
