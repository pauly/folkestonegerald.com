Just called up to get a table for the weekly quiz at <a href="/wiki/britannia">The Britannia</a>, Horn Street, and they're fully booked! They have a reserve list of ten alredy. Food this week is chicken and chips which is obviously very popular.

We went to that quiz again this week, it was curry night, very good indeed! we came third, which meant winning our entry fee back. We will be back again soon!
