<blockquote>Arsonists hit another town firm

Report by Sarah Shaffi

ARSONISTS have struck again in a string of attacks on businesses in Folkestone's town centre.

The latest attack occurred at the rear of <a href="/wiki/la+vue">La Vue</a> in <a href="/wiki/west+terrace">West Terrace</a> on February 23.

Early on Friday morning a number of items were set alight in the car park, including planks of wood, rubble and old radiators.

The smouldering pile was found yards away from the wheelie bins in the car park and the area was cordoned off while police investigated.

This is the fourth attack in the town centre in four weeks.</blockquote>
