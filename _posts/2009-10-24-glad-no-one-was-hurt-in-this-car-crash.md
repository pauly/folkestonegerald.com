<a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/news/2009/october/23/car_crashes_into_shop.aspx">Car crashes into Motorbike shop</a>, a friend said (his friend said) he saw a baby buggy in the crash wreckage, glad that turns out to be a false alarm. The accident happened at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alford+brothers">Alford Brothers</a> on Cheriton Road last Wednesday night.
