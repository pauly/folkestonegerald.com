Free parking in some overflow car park or other if you have three people in your card <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kol08/article/default.asp?article_id=43430">it says here</a>. Also a shuttlebus will be taking you to and from Westenhanger and Ashford stations, I hope that's free but I really don't know.

I should be going to this really shouldn't I, everyone at <a href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk">work</a> is. If we didn't have a birthday bash in London right in the (Saturday night) middle of it I think I would.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk">kentonline.co.uk</a>. <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/venue/279177/">Get your tickets here</a>, or [ebay=zoo thousand tickets]remember there might be bargains on ebay[/ebay]
