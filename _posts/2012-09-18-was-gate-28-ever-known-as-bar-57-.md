<a href="/wiki/richard+wallace">Richard Wallace</a> writing in the new <a href="http://www.gofolkestone.org.uk">Go Folkestone</a> free pamplet talks about eating in <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> "in the former <a href="/wiki/bar+57">Bar 57</a>". What is <a href="/wiki/bar+57">Bar 57</a>? What was in that building before <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a>? Is it just a mistake or am I missing some history here?
