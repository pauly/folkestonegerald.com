So, we're getting a <a href="http://www.starbucks.co.uk Starbucks]]" title="the Herald">in Folkestone within the next two weeks, according to a small news piece in [[folkestone herald</a>. You may think these chain coffee stores are the enemy, but they're surely a sign of regeneration, which is a good thing. AND, they do food and drinks especially aimed at vegans, very progressive, big thumbs up.

No venue confirmed yet, but my money is on Sandgate Road, the Ciro Citterio  suit shop opposite Debenhams has closed down in a bit of a hurry, could be there. 

Noticed yesterday too that the British Heart Foundation shop is also closing, remember when charity shops close this is also a good thing, it means there's a real business paying full rent that's waiting to move in.

What on earth is going to fill the space left by M&S though? That's one huge store...
