<blockquote>We at Capel-le-Ferne Farmers Market do our utmost to provide Local Produce at a fair price, and we have continued to do this, with support from our customers and stallholders, for the past 6 years.  We were one of the first and have also earned two Awards, both in 2004.   

We have approximately 20 stalls each week selling a wide variety of produce i.e. Fish, Meat, Eggs, Vegetables, Fruit, Bread, Cakes, Pastries.  Delicatessen, Preserves, Chocolates, Dog Biscuits, Plants and Crafts.  Refreshments are also provided in a friendly atmosphere. 

It is also important for us to support our local producers and farmers in the present recession, and we are always searching for new producers in the South East area.  Are you one of those? 

Farmers Markets are a great way to start a business, low overheads and a good customer base who are looking for good wholesome food, locally made. Our market is held every Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. in the village hall, which is another bonus, as many farmers markets are outside! 
To begin you will need (where necessary of course) a Health & Hygiene Certificate, your kitchen registered with your local council and public liability insurance.  If you meet all this criteria and you have a new product you wish to sell, please contact us on 07899 082356 or e mail capelfarmersmarket@yahoo.co.uk or visit our website for further information <a href="http://www.capel-le-ferne.org">capel-le-ferne.org</a></blockquote>
