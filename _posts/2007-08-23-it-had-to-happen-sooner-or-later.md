Not a great meal from Escondido! Slight repost from <a href="/wiki/blog">the blog</a>, just so it goes on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/45/Escondido" title="I'm still working on this section...">the all new (slightly worse than before) page about Escondido</a>, part of my <a href="/wiki/sandgate">guide to Sandgate bars and restaurants</a>:

<blockquote>Actually it wasn't 100%, Escondido had a bit of an off day, forgetting my starter, then bringing me the wrong main, then rushing my second main out so fast that it wasn't really cooked. Fair play to them, they knocked 50% off our bill. Also (not their fault) they've changed the menu, and messed with the Bunuela pudding, adding chocolate to it, boo</blockquote>

Shame, but I'll be back again ASAP... Check out <a href="http://www.escondido-mex.co.uk/menu/">their new menu online</a>.
