And it's back at Lanterns! And it's pay day! Ian Cognito headlines, here's the (nearly) full lineup:

<blockquote>Tom Price is a British Actor and one of the stars of the Five Comedy show Swinging. He has also appeared as police officer PC Andy Davidson in a number of episodes of the first two series of Torchwood, a spin-off of the long running science fiction series Doctor Who, a role he is set to reprise in the third series. He played Gordon, a young drunken doctor, in the BBC Radio 4 comedy show Rigor Mortis for three series, alongside Peter Davison. He is the voice of Nescafe. He is currently appearing in the new BBC Three sketch show The Wrong Door and will also be playing the role of Darrin Stephens in the new UK remake of Bewitched filming in January 2009

Price is an inventive comic who's a lot cheekier than his middle-class persona would initially suggest.

He indulges in a fair bit of sardonic badinage about his native Wales, but does so with more than a hint of originally - no sheep are mentioned, even if backwater in breeding is.

His act mixes intelligent, unexpected gags with baser scatological material.

It proves a successful blend, crowd-pleasing but with enough twists to satisfy the more discerning comedy connoisseur.

Though grounded in sketch comedy, Price is taking to stand-up like a natural. One to watch.

"Hilarious!" The Mirror, Pick of the week.

"The cream of worthy talent, very funny, a top laugh". Loaded.

"Expect big things" The Edinburgh Evening News.

Pippa Evans studied drama and theatre arts at Birmingham University, before turning to stand-up and improv. She was chosen by the Pleasance Edinburgh to perform in The 2006 Comedy Reserve, was runner-up in the 2008 Hackney Empire new act final, and a finalist in Funny Women the same year. She has been a regular improv performer with Improvedy and The Scratch Players.

She made her Edinburgh debut in 2008 with Pippa Evans And Other Lonely People, which was nominated for the if. Comedy best newcomer prize.

Pippa Evans most often performs as scarily intense singer-songwriter Loretta Maine. This wonderfully unbalanced character flips between sweet and psychotic in a chord change, as she delivers beautifully bitter lyrics about the men  and the music business  that have wronged her.

The nuanced songs are great on their own, before you even consider some of the truly impressive one-liners between them. These inspired, quotable pearls of wisdom show that fine comic writing underpins her flawless, perfectly timed performance. Her set is subtle enough to be believable, but not too understated to be hilarious.

Shes a relative newcomer, but has certainly got the talent for a sustained and stellar career in comedy.

"Breathtakingly talented. I foresee no obstacles to reaching the very top" Chortle


Ian Cognito Aggressive, unpredictable, confrontational and sometimes downright nasty - the adjectives that spring to mind to describe Cognito aren't those usually associated with a jolly stand-up comedian. Thankfully, though, 'bloody funny' is top of the list

Banned from more than a dozen comedy clubs because of his irascible behavior, Cognito delights in playing with audience's sensibilities. He'll win cheers with an emotive speech against domestic violence - then puncture it by suggesting Posh Spice deserves a good slap. And the supposedly liberal-minded comedy crowd have a good laugh.

It's with this wind-up material that Cognito excels, though he's not beyond a good knob gag, and when on form he is unbeatable.

Very occasionally his drive to shock sacrifices laughs for controversy. But for the most part, Cognito's electrifying bitterness lends a genuine edge to his act - a facet often missing in an increasingly commercial comedy landscape.


Ian Cognito is one of the best comics on the national circuit, a veteran who clearly knows what hes doing as he spits his darkly humorous vitriol over an unsuspecting crowd. Outspoken, opinionated, and totally clued up, this mans take on the world will have you convinced and convulsed (with laughter).

"Cognitos indignant polemic is a bracing antidote to more amiable routines. When a comedian can transform rage into humour without diluting their passion, the result is always riveting. Share his inspired madness." - William Cook, The Guardian

"Cognito puts them all in the shade. If you want to know whats wrong with New Britain, Ian Cognitos going to tell you. And if you dont, youd better keep your mouth shut. Just stunning." - Phil Daoust, The Guardian

"Ian Cognito is up there with the greats. He rants - but not without thought." - Evening Standard

"There is no doubting Ian Cognitos blazing talent as a stand-up." - Time Out</blockquote>
