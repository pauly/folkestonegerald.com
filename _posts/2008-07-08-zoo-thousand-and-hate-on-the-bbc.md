<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7494952.stm">Here</a>. Main things to be said are:

* The organisers miscalculated cash flow
* They had to cancel acts
* <a href="/wiki/port+lympne">Port Lympne</a> stepped in, writing out a check for <a href="/wiki/ash">Ash</a> there and then to ensure they'd go on stage

Good on <a href="/wiki/port+lympne">Port Lympne</a>! I can't believe the same organisers are going to try again next year... maybe we'll give it a go, if the price is right.

(IE [reply]get in touch[/reply], I will write nice stuff for free tickets).
