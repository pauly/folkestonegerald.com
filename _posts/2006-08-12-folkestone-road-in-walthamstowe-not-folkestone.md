From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a> regarding recent things;

<blockquote>At least three of the men arrested on suspicion of being involved in a terror plot to blow up a series of transatlantic planes had converted to Islam, it emerged.

Ibrahim Savant, from Walthamstow, east London, changed his name from Oliver when he converted, according to neighbours. The 25-year-old student, whose Muslim wife is reportedly pregnant, was arrested at his family home in Folkestone Road.</blockquote>
