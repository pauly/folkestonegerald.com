<blockquote>I lived in Folkestone until 1980 and if memory serves, this restaurant is virtually next to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2470/East%20Kent%20Arms">the East Kent pub</a> (is that still there?). Anyway, I took my girlfriend there for prawn cocktail, steak and chips and black forest gateau.</blockquote>
