I have a dear friend visiting from Wales to do a gig in Folkestone on 26th March,at the Living room Folkestone. She is a very talented and beautiful singer/songwriter. She is looking for a second gig to ofset the costs of her travel and has the most awesome voice and lyrics. Are you able to offer a Sunday slot around that date? Too good an opportunity to miss? A CLASS Act!
Many thanks
