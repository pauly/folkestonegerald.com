From <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=eamon+everall">Eamon Everall</a> no less:

<blockquote>Hi, you ask for info on Folkestone School of Art ,  I went there from 1966 to 1967. When i went it was where the multi story car park opposite the junction of [gmap]Alexandra Gardens & Middleburg Square[/gmap], now is. More or less opposite was <a href="/wiki/gales+cafe">Gales Cafe</a> & a huge ramshackle pub , now gone. Essentially it was a Foundation (pre-18) Art School preparing students for higher level courses elsewhere  although there were also a few local vocational courses in applied arts subject like Graphics, etc. Housed in an odd mix of buildings from a victorian chapel to a georgain town house it was a very lively place which attracted students from across Kent-not too popular with the powers that be tho., due to the Bohemian nature of the students. When I was there the Principal was <a href="/wiki/gerald+norden">Gerald Norden</a> a nice old bloke & pretty good painter with a national reputation, he was succeeded by <a href="/wiki/john+everleigh">John Everleigh</a> who, tho elderly, is still around & living in the <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> area. </blockquote>

Any information like this about any parts of <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> that we no longer have are very much appreciated.
