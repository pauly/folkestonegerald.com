The Grand was built as "Gentlemen's Residential Chambers" just over 100 years ago.   It operates as an "Apartment Hotel";  the apartments are self contained with their own kitchen facilities, but are serviced, and there are bars and restaurants.   So one has the best of both worlds - an apartment with hotel facilities.
