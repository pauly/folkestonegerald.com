Just found your blog, it's nice to see someone else who enthuses about Folkestone. We bought a place down here in September andalso spend most of the week looking forward the Friday night dash down to Folkestone. We live near the harbour and spend the weekends trying out the pubs and restaurants. We bought our house in the belief that Folkestone is on the up, not to make a profit but because we want a slightly saner lifestyle. Hoping that at sometime in the not too distant future we will be able to find work here as well but that may take a while (we both work in music/TV biz, not much scope for that in Folkestone - yet).

Oh yes, Roger de Haan rocks!
