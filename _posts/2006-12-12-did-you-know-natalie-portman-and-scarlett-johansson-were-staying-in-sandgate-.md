Before / during I mean, we all read about it in the Herald after they'd checked out... La Portman wasn't the most favoured guest of [fg]The Sandgate Hotel[/fg] apparently. From <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk">The Mirror</a>, don't go there though it's covered in microsoft adverts that make moving around it hard work.

<blockquote>STORMY PORT IS ON THE DARK SIDE
Eva Simpson & Caroline Hedley

STAR Wars actress Natalie Portman has fallen for the dark side of the Force judging by the reaction of staff at Sandgate Hotel, Folkestone, Kent.

Filming The Other Boleyn Girl with Scarlett Johansson, Nat, 25, asked the hotel to shut the bar at 10pm, then disturbed other guests with 5am yoga sessions.

She persuaded staff to prepare a lavish party for her, Scarlett and crew but couldn't attend at the last minute.

One of the staff told us: "We were relieved when she left." Nat's people didn't answer our calls...</blockquote>
