Went last night, they seem to be fixed on their <a href="http://www.escondido-mex.co.uk/sandgate_menu.php">new short menu</a> now. Seemingly no side dishes at all, where did they go? Did I just miss them? They are listed on that menu but I am sure they weren't on the printed menu... Also there is no vegan option there now. Probably there never was a vegan option, but while I didn't know that the vegetable paella vegetables were honey roasted, or the vegetable fajitas were cooked in garlic butter I was OK. But now they blatantly list these critical details on <a href="http://www.escondido-mex.co.uk/sandgate_menu.php">the menu</a>! Good for people with allergies or properly strict vegans I suppose.

Five of us went, my paella was a bit dull without any accompaniments. I managed to snaffle some bits and pieces from the two fajitas, they seem to have been a success. The other two chaps had chili though, and it was apparently not great, not at all spicy.
The wife still likes it, but I have now officially gone off <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a>.
