Where is the lineup? <a href="http://www.folkestonelitfest.co.uk">folkestonelitfest.co.uk</a> has nothing yet. I really should have already joined up as a friend and be running their site for them shouldn't I...

Names I've heard so far include [abe]Will Self[/abe], [abe]John Hegley[/abe] and a return for local lad [abe]David Starkey[/abe], but no idea of venues or dates yet, except that it runs from the 1st to the 9th of November. 

UPDATE: Aha, <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> says [abe]Maureen Lipman[/abe], [abe]Kate Adie[/abe], [abe]John Bird[/abe], [abe]Joanna Trollope[/abe], [abe]Ffion Hague[/abe], [abe]Mary Berry[/abe], and most excitingly (if it's her off <a href="/wiki/countdown">Countdown</a>) [abe]Susie Dent[/abe].

<a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-literature-literaryfestivals-november.htm">British Arts Council</a> has this, but it's all about last year's really:

<blockquote> Now in its 8th year, the Folkestone Literary Festival will play host over 50 speakers, entertainers, poets and creatives in a packed schedule promising 9 days of entertaining live performances. Authors in 2007 included [abe]Terry Jones[/abe], [abe]David Frost[/abe], [abe]Roy Hattersley[/abe], [abe]Nicholas Parsons[/abe], [abe]Tony Benn[/abe], [abe]David Starkey[/abe], [abe]James Naughtie[/abe], S[abe]andra Howard[/abe] and [abe]John Humphrys[/abe]. The 2007 Festival programme also included a special Childrens event including performances from former Children's Laureate [abe]Michael Morpurgo[/abe], family reading sessions, a new event for young people featuring [abe]Colin Foreman[/abe], film screenings (including [abe]Al Gore's [/abe]"An Inconvenient Truth"), a Cabaret evening, book swap, exhibitions, tours of the town and more. This year will see even more events to celebrate all that is literary at the festival which has fast become one of the region's most important cultural events.
