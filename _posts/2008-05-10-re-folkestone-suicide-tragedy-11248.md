I can confirm that Rosie had just come from an interview in which her return to work part-time was discussed positively. She had been treated for depression and everything seemed to be going well. It is so sad that, just when life had begun to look rosy, Rosie took her own life. Who knows what goes on in a person's mind at a point like that ... I believe that reality for such a person suddenly becomes no more than the posters on the sides of the Undergound and one's sole destination seems to be at the end of the dark tunnel beyond the platform.

My feelings are with her family and with those people who had to witness and deal with her smashed body.
