Just found <a href="http://www.photographyinmyblood.com">this site</a> that has a whole load of new material for my Folkestone gig history... Including <a href="http://www.photographyinmyblood.com/image-viewer.htm?gallery/Fgallerysub12-5-9.jpg">pictures of the Rolling Stones</a> when they played at the Odeon on Sandgate Road. Were you there?

I was inspired to search again for this as there are mentions of the gig in <a href="http://www.gofolkestone.org.uk">Go Folkestone</a>'s magazine that just came through the door...
