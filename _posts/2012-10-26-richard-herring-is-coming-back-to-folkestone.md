<a href="/wiki/richard+herring">Richard Herring</a> is coming back to the <a href="/wiki/cheesegrater">Cheesegrater</a> in April with his <a href="/wiki/talking+cock">Talking Cock</a> show. The show is over ten years old now, but I saw it at Edinburgh this year and it's constantly changing... there is a survey to be filled out on <a href="http://www.richardherring.com">richardherring.com</a> where you can take part in the show before it's even happend...
