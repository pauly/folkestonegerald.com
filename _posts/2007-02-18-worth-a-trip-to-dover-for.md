Went to <a href="/wiki/blakes">Blakes</a> yesterday, what an amazing place! Really looking forward to going back next week to eat there, just drank very fine beer this time.

There's not much on <a href="http://www.blakesofdover.com">their website</a>, but <a href="http://www.blakesofdover.com/includes/nav.php">if you look here</a> looks like there's meant to be more to it...
