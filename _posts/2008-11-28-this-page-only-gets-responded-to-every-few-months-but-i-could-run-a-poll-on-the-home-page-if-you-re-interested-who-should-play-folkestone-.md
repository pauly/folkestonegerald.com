Who I would like to come to Folkestone (again in some cases):

<a href="/wiki/cure">The Cure</a> (ha!)

<a href="/wiki/magic+numbers">The Magic Numbers</a>

<a href="/wiki/super+furry+animals">Super Furry Animals</a>

<a href="/wiki/david+devant+and+his+spirit+wife">David Devant and his Spirit Wife</a>

<a href="/wiki/belle+and+sebastian">Belle and Sebastian</a>

<a href="/wiki/suede">Suede</a> (maybe they'll get back together soon)

This is not for <a href="/wiki/zoo+thousand">Zoo Thousand</a> / <a href="/wiki/zoo9">ZOO9</a> is it? Think it might be an effort to get people to trust that again. Guessing it's for the <a href="/wiki/quarter+house">Quarter House</a>, the new theatre on Tontine Street, am I right? If you get a good band to play the opening night, I want in.
