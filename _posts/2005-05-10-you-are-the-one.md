Got an email:

I was wondering whether you could publicise the following event that I am holding.  I am creating a CD in order to raise money for CR-UK and have enlisted the help of a band called <a href="http://www.nightshiftmusic.co.uk">NIGHTSHIFT</a> I am holding a launch night for the CD on 8th July 2005 in <a href="/wiki/whitstable+whitstable+kent">Whitstable|Whitstable, Kent</a>. For more details you can visit <a href="http://www.youaretheone.org.uk">youaretheone.org.uk</a> or see the attached poster.  All of the monies raised will go directly to CR-UK a charity i feel strongly about as i lost my father to the disease.  Tickets are priced at 7 and include a copy of the CD.  A charity Auction will also be held on the night.

Tickets available from dominic.comins@activelifeltd.co.uk or by calling
