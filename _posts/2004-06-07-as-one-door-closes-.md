Delighted to discover this weekend that bucking the trend of bars and restaurants closing, there's a new face in town, a really rather ace looking new bar...

<a href="/wiki/office">The Office</a> is a spanking new basement bar on The Leas that we found by chance yesterday. It's been open since Friday (4th June), though there's been no publicity or official opening do yet, as they're still polishing off a rough edges. It's a very impressive looking bar, you enter down a few steps maybe expecting a gloomy cellar, only to be confronted with a bubblegum pink bar and a very smart lounge. It's like Barbie's own <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a>, it looks very Brighton, and is just the sort of thing Folkestone needs!

There's the usual range of bottled drinks and some lagers, including "Kronenbourg White", a fruity wheat beer. It's not an ale lovers place, it's like to be *the* pre club destination, get in there quick before it's full of chavs!
