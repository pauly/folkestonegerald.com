Someone's been having some fun with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkestone">the Folkestone entry in wikipedia</a>... it says:

<blockquote><a href="/wiki/creative+foundation">The Creative Foundation</a> is a new charitable organisation which is acquiring a large number of run-down properties in the <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter+of+folkestone">Creative Quarter of Folkestone</a> (the oldest part of town, including the <a href="/wiki/old+high+street">Old High Street</a> and <a href="/wiki/bayle">The Bayle</a>), renovating them and letting them at long-term affordable rents as workspaces for artists and creative businesses(some with living accommodation).

Two painters, a fisherman, an independent fashion guru, a bronze monkey, a musician (he says he is), no graphic designers, no filmmakers, etc are all taking space as the renovation work is completed.</blockquote>

Cheeky! You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkestone">edit this here</a>, anyone can, there's always mischief afoot...
