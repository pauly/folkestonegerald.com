In his <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/metro/interviews/interview.html?in_page_id=8&in_interview_id=882">60 second interview in today's Metro</a>, <a href="/wiki/bill+nighy">Bill Nighy</a> confesses that he once discarded a pair of pants in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>:

Were you a Hemingway fan?
I still am. I read somewhere that Ernest Hemingway didn't wear underwear, so, on my way to Paris, I abandoned mine in the English Channel at Folkestone, the more to be like him. I loved his short stories, They blew my mind. He was a very radical writer. People pooh-poohed him as soon as he was dead, like they do with everybody because in order to embolden themselves, they diminish somebody else. He remains one of the great writers.
