"Reporter Amy Woodland and the Folkestone Herald were also successful, taking home the Campaign of the Year Award, for their successful efforts to renovate the bandstand in Folkestone" <a href="http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/awards/060202shep.shtml">says hold the front page</a>...

This bandstand campaign was started in MYSTERIOUS circumstances, with notes apparently left on the bandstand saying things like "help me", "don't let me rust away" etc... MYSTERIOUSLY these were then reported in The Herald, which then started its own campaign to save the bandstand.
