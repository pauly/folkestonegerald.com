From someone on <a href="/wiki/mr+gig">mr gig</a>:

<blockquote><a href="/wiki/toft+s">Toft's</a> Jazz Club was just down the hill from the <a href="/wiki/harp+club">Harp Club</a>.  Stand outside the harp, turn left (looking at the roundabout).  Cross the road to the library, turn left and walk down past the roundabout.  Its a big building on the left.  Was Tom Brown's, is now houses / offices or something?</blockquote>

Seems <a href="/wiki/fleetwood+mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> also played <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> at some point, and <a href="/wiki/manics">The Manics</a> really did play the Metronome:

<blockquote>I can 100% confirm FACT that <a href="/wiki/suede">Suede</a> did support <a href="/wiki/kingmaker">Kingmaker</a> at the <a href="/wiki/metronome">Metronome</a> and that the Manics did play there on a Sunday night - I was there. <a href="/wiki/pj+harvey">PJ Harvey</a> also played at the Metronome and the <a href="/wiki/comedy+club">Comedy Club</a> saw appearances from <a href="/wiki/jo+brand">Jo Brand</a> and <a href="/wiki/harry+hill">Harry Hill</a>.</blockquote>
