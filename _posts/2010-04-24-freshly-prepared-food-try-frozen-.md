Had a meal at Sandgate Hotel last night with two friends. The service was slow though the staff were very pleasant and chatty. My friends both enjoyed their main courses - though they arrived an hour after we arrived! My meal however was a real disappointment. The saute potatoes and courgettes were beautiful but as the menu stated that all our food is freshly prepared I was rather surprised to find the centre of my vegetable and dolcelatte tart was still frozen! The waitress took the price of the bill but I had to come home and raid the fridge as I was obviously still hungry! Wine good and venue stunning but a real shame about the food.
