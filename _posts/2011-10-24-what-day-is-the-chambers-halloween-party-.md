Not sure if it is Friday or Saturday, I have written both down at some point... Also is fancy dress really mandatory? I have a babysitter for Friday night so hoping it is then but really don't have the time to sort out an elaborate costume. Would be a shame to have a free night out and not be able to go to Chambers...

Chambers own website is down right now "suspended", not sure what for...

UPDATE: The party is Saturday, we're still going Friday instead though.
