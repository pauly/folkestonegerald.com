Really enjoyed the new <a href="/wiki/jonathan+creek">Jonathan Creek</a> last night, although it was absolutely ludicrous. And now I see <a href="/wiki/alan+davies">Alan Davies</a> is <a href="http://www.atgtickets.com/shows/alan-davies-life-is-pain/leas-cliff-hall/">coming to Folkestone on November 16th</a>. This is the <a href="/wiki/life+is+pain">Life Is Pain</a> show, that we saw in <a href="/wiki/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> donchaknow, so I don't suppose we'll go and see it again.
