On a technical level, I don't like <a href="http://www.sosfolkestone.info">sosfolkestone.info</a> but that could be just me being a nerd. They do have a little forum there with a lot more activity than this one, and some more info on <a href="/wiki/roger+dehaan">Roger Dehaan</a>'s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=roger%20dehaan%20masterplan%20folkestone">masterplan for Folkestone</a>, including some pictures. They include this report on his recent presentation:

<blockquote>Over the last week (20th March onwards) Roger De Haan has been presenting his seafront plans to various groups before it goes public on April 1st (open for public consultation).
On Tuesday 21st March, so many people turned up, that two presentations had to be held!
SOS members, Julie Balliu & Simon Everett were lucky enough to be in one of these presentations and have prepared short notes for you to see/read and make your own judgements.

Brief Review:
As you are aware, Roger De Haan owns the Harbour, and has great plans for this area, but he did mention that without the land owned by Jimmy Godden incorporated into the project, the whole thing would not flow as it should do. The thought is that JG will sell the land; if he doesnt it could be met with a compulsory purchase - but only if the community/people of Folkestone want this to happen.

De Haan's legal advisors have been writing to Shepway District Council for a long period of time regarding this issue, with emphasis on the fact of errors in the process/planning application regarding JG land. The Trent plans have not received planning consent as yet, as they are unable to meet the conditions of the Planning Committee of SDC.
As we speak, Trent are currently submitting new plans to the SDC.

It has been found that, under new House of Lords decisions, SDC can change their mind on the Trent/JG planning issue, and they cannot be sued if they do so.

De Haan clearly stated that the whole seafront project is for the people of Folkestone, for its regeneration and its future. He would not be involved in such a thing, if he didnt think the people wanted it. Therefore, if you do like the proposed plans, you must speak out and let your councillor/SDC know of this. Your thoughts and opinions matter.

Please review De Haans aims and objectives, as well as some rather blurred (!) photographs of his proposed plans, which will probably take up to six years to complete.</blockquote>
