<a href="/wiki/more+tales+from+the+tap+room">More Tales From The Tap Room</a>, I have it in front of me now, I won't reproduce it here though, you can get it in Ottakers. It dates from at least 1782, where it shows up on a survey, it was owned by the mayor's son and then run as a school before starting as a pub in 1841.

Ah, the building was actually replaced, in 1887. There are pictures of both the old and the new <a href="/wiki/prince+albert">Prince Albert</a> in the book. Seems to have been popular around 1990 as a bar called <a href="/wiki/bertie+s">Bertie's</a> too.

In one of these pictures you can see the <a href="/wiki/metronome">Metronome</a> next door, and that it's a bingo and social club called <a href="/wiki/rio">Rio</a>. It was a cinema at some point.

If you find out any more about the place, please post it up here. I will check out your views online, we have quite a nice view across the town towards the Martello towers from our place in <a href="/wiki/earls+avenue">Earls Avenue</a>.
