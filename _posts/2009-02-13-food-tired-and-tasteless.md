After eating probably the worst Christmas office lunch of my life at the Tavernetta the year before last (equivalent of a 1 Iceland frozen dinner) I finally decided to give the place another try.  I definately will not be going there again.  The food really is quite poor.  For fish to be that spongy, watery and tasteles it just had to be frozen - which I dont expect as it was not a cheap main course..  The bread basket was a couple of supermarket type rolls and some toast, and generally it all was tired and a fairly poor standard.  Not sure why others say this is a good place.  Not in my experience.
