Haha Folkestone dad Lee Webb sent his three year old to "smarty pants" nursery in Folkestone with a bag of drugs and knives instead of his packed lunch, <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/dad-sent-son-to-nursery-30000/">it says here</a>... Shocking! I'm sure lunch is provided at number two son's nursery.
