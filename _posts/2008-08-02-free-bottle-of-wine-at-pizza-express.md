Register at <a href="http://www.filippoberio.co.uk">filippoberio.co.uk</a>, got to <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.filippoberio.co.uk/p_r_o_m_o_t_i_o_n_s/default.asp?theid=24">promotions</a>, and enter the "you can only possibly know this if you actually bought a bottle of olive oil" code "VINO EXPRESS". Ping, a free bottle of wine next time you go to Pizza Express. We already got ours.

The only drawback (isn't there always one) is that you have to spend over twenty quid to qualify. If we ever went to [fg]Pizza Express[/fg] and did not buy wine, our bill probably wouldn't normally reach that limit. The value of the wine is not included in the twenty pounds...
