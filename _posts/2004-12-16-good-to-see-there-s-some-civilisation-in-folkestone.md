Here I was thinking that everyone between the ages of 16 and 60 had left town in a hurry... I moved down here last December (in fact, today is my year's anniversary), trading a tiny 2-up-2-down in Streatham for a monster Victorian place close to Folkestone town centre (which is costing me a fortune to do up).

Restaurants - try The India on Rendezvous Street, the food IMO is a lot better than the New Delhi (altho' the service can be slow), or there's a new one in Elham - the "Blue Vinny" - which looks quite posh, and will apparently be the subject of a TV programme next autumn.

I'm not sure of blogging etiquette re. e-mail addresses, but I'm keen to meet people locally, especially anyone who plays squash, cricket or five-a-side footie at a poor standard, or who fancies starting a crap rock covers band. My e-mail is michaelgalvan@yahoo.co.uk. Oh, and I'm ALWAYS up for a pub quiz...
