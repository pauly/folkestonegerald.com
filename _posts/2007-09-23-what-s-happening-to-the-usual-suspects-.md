Long closed bar <a href="/wiki/usual+suspects">The Usual Suspects</a> seems to be in the process of renovation / conversion at last:

We do need more good pubs in that area, <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter">The Creative Quarter</a> does need a fine landmark defining local, but I'm not convinced that's what it'll become, if it reopens as licensed premises again at all... That whole <a href="/wiki/old+high+street">Old High Street</a> regeneration still does seem a bit slow.

How long before that frontage is defaced with some bad <a href="/wiki/graffiti">graffiti</a>?
