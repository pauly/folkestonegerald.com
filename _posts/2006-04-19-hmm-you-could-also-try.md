<a href="http://www.mrgig.com">mrgig.com</a>, they both seem to be mostly pub bands to me though. I would give whoever promotes the bands at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/32/Lanterns">Lanterns</a> (that used to promote at <a href="/wiki/stripes">Stripes</a>), that seems to be more the style of music, and they don't seem to bother with the other local band sites. Also, <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/34/The%20Harp%20Club">The Harp Club</a> could be a goer.

<a href="http://www.onfolkestone.co.uk">onfolkestone.co.uk</a> seems to have more of the young metal crowd gigs listed, hopefully this site will have the best listings of all.
