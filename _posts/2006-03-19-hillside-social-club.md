Tofts and The Hillside Social were Completly different clubs. The Hillside Social was on another part of Grace Hill and closed before the end of the sixties. Tofts went on well into the 70's and later became a disco. Tofts when hosting live bands never served alchohol it had indeed in its basement a 60's style Coffee Bar. I played many times at Tofts and supported Fleetwood Mac, Canned Heat and The Moody Blues there. I believe the Black Sabath gig was at the Art College (now demolished) which was indeed on Bouverie Road opposite the old police station I know for sure Hawkwind played there as well. Hope this is of some interest. Love the sight.
