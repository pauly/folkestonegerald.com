I used to go to Tofts regularly during the 60s (when it was at Grace Hill). Used to be one of my favourite venues. (The other being the Epress Ballroom, a bit further down the hill on the other side)

Can't remember dates, but I saw Long John Baldry there, when he put his head through the low ceiling.

By far the best band performing there were Geno Washington and the Ram Jam Band. They were great Tofts favourites
