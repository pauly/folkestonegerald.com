<blockquote>On the tasting table this weekend.....

Reds

2005 Gaia, Grosset, Clare Valley:  Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend produced from the highest vineyard in Clare Valley, at an altitude of 570 Metres. And it shows, such is the freshness and purity of the fruit. A wine of such ripeness yet restraint, finesse and exuberance; a style seldom seen in Australia. A monumental wine from ones of the worlds best producers - 27.50
2007 Bourgogne Pinot Noir, Boisset: Beautiful example of Burgundian Ponot Noir and particularly of the 2007 vintage. Fresh lush strawberry fruit and floral undertones with a classic hint of wild mushrooms. This is one for drinking now and 20 minutes or so in the fridge brings out the youthful and vibrant fruits even more - 12.95 
Whites

2009 Margaret River White, Cullen, Western Australia: Vanya Cullen believes that great wines are made in the vineyard, hence the conversion of her vines to organic status. This fragrant, zippy blend of Sauvignon, Semillon, Chardonnay and Verdelho is delicious by itself or with a bowl of mussels - 12.95
2008 Marlborough Classic Riesling, Framingham, New Zealand: Entising white from Marlborough. Bouquet of perfumed, floral aromatics of jasmine and honeysuckle greets you, while the palate offers flavours of lime and orange citrus, stonefruit and mineral. The residual sugar in the wine is balanced with a backbone of firm, natural acidity giving a long, dry finish. Excellent with curries and fusion food - 11.95
