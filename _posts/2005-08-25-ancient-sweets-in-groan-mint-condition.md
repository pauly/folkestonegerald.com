Jars of sweets which are thought to be at least 45 years old have been discovered at a bus station in Folkestone, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4180194.stm">says the BBC</a>... they're being shipped off to a museum in Battle, Sussex - why could they not be kept in Folkestone somewhere?

Will we get more discoveries like this, now the whole town centre is to be ripped up? Went walking through the car park area intended for the new shopping centre the other day, and I think I'll go back to snap some pictures before some of the old buildings are knocked beyond recognition.
