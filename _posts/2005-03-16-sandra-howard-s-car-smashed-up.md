Mrs Michael Howard's prized Fiat Panda has been vandalised at Westenhanger station, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/4351289.stm">says the BBC</a>. This is gutting for her, I know I was really pissed off when my car was done over. Hopefully because of her profile, this will be investigated properly, and someone who might break into your car or my car will be HANGED.
