Dear sir,I see by your site you put on live music-would you ever consider putting on live jazz mid week--with either a trio or quartet,Our website is [url]WWW.POPEJAZZ.COM[/url]
This style of jazz is quite popular in a few venues in Folkestone;anyway consider it and get back to us.Thanks Teddy Pope.
