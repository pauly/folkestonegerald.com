Sorry to jump in but I'm seeing some valuable input here. You're all clearly live music fans so could I ask you all who would be your top 5 live bands to see. It would be most helpful if they are current and still performing and preferably the kind of bands who would come to Folkestone (by that I mean not those that sell out enormous venues!).
There is a reason for my interest and I will reveal all shortly. 
Thanks in advance for your help!
