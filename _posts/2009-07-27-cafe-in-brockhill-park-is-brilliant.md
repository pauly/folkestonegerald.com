Have known there was an all vege place there for a while but not got around to going. My birthday today, the wife suggested it, and so we did! It's nothing fancy, and it's very very reasonably priced, but it was delicious, vege burger and chips for me and a goats cheese tart and potatoes for the wife, and we both had a delicious apple charlotte for desert with ice cream. Recommended!
