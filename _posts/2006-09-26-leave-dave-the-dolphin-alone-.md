The <a href="/wiki/folkestone+dolphin">Folkestone Dolphin</a> <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006440681,00.html">is in The Sun today</a>:
<blockquote>JET skiers and kayakers will be prosecuted if they harass a dolphin that has taken up residence in the English Channel.

The dolphin who has been nicknamed "Dave" has made the sea off Folkestone, Kent, his home over the past few months. 

He can regularly be seen swimming along the reef between Seabrook and Folkestone harbour.

The warning from Kent Police comes after reports that people in kayaks were harassing Dave today.

Police say jet skiers and people in motor boats were getting close to him on recent occasions.

A Kent Police spokesman said: Kent Police is asking the public to help protect Dave by reporting any behaviour by jet skiers and kayakers that may harm him.

"The Marine Unit may also be patrolling that area of coast and will take action against anyone who is annoying Dave."

Dolphins are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which makes it an offence to recklessly or intentionally harass them.

PC Andy Small, Kent Police rural and environmental crime coordinator, said: Dolphins are well loved creatures and very friendly towards humans. However, they are wild animals and should be treated with respect.

"Boats, jet skis and kayaks should keep a distance of about 100m from the dolphin and people must not approach, grab, touch or try to swim with him."</blockquote>
