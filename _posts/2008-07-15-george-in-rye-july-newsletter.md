<blockquote>We've been rather quiet on the newsletter front lately, having been nominated for UK Newcomer of the Year in the CATEY Awards, the Oscars of the Restaurant and Hotel world (sadly, the ceremony was not in LA). This award has previously been won by the likes of Tom Aiken, Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsay and we were extremely nervous. The awards were this week, and we were very nervous as we were in the final three. We didn't win but it was brilliant to be considered alongside some really respected places. Thanks so much to all of you for your feedback and suggestions since we first opened, which have helped us to improve The George and get it to where it is today!

Fancy cooking has its place, but often the simple things bring the most pride - homemade bread possibly being the best of all (ok, maybe brownies share joint 1st place).

We recently found the Lighthouse Bakery, an independent store set up in 2000 in South London by Rachel Duffield and Elizabeth Weisberg. Their artisan bread has won many plaudits and there was always a queue round the block from people desperate to get their hands on the best croissants, sourdough and baguettes in town. Luckily for us, they moved the bakery to East Sussex last year.

With Elizabeth and Rachel, we are launching the Baker Break - a one night stay where, in addition to room, dinner and breakfast, you get to trot on over to the bakery and participate in a day-long class of your choice. Per person this comes to 240 (based on two sharing) and is available Sunday - Thursday evenings. Weekends are also available at regular room-rates. To find out more, look here.

With holidays approaching fast, Kids go free from now until the end of August when sharing a room, or take advantage of one of our interconnecting rooms for 100 for the kid's room in addition to adults at standard rate. Here's an idea for a lovely day trip near Rye: take bucket and spades down to Camber Sands and mess about on the beach for a while. Then you can go on a boat ride over to the historic Bodiam Castle and explore the battlements, rampart and moat (the kids can also try on a suit of armour). The afternoon is perfect for a miniature steam train ride at Dungeness, and in the evening, head to Hastings Old Town for dodgems on the sea front and some fish and chips, or take a seat at the traditional big-top circus tent in Rye.

That should keep you busy!

Best Wishes

Alex and Katie Clarke
