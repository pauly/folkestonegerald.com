Everyone's got <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, right? See <a href="http://twitter.com/folkestone">Folkestone Gerald's official twitter feed</a>, and wherever you see Twitter on the page, click there to post your comment on Twitter, including a code that will be picked up again by this site. Clever stuff!

Likewise you may have noticed that any posts on Twitter regarding Folkestone are automatically picked up on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">the homepage</a>. And if you loiter on that page, and Folkestone mentions are active enough, you'll see the page refresh before your very eyes...

Have fun!
