<blockquote>A KILLER dog virus has struck in Folkestone, claiming three victims and it is feared it will spread.

The deadly parvovirus has killed three dogs from the same household and a vet has warned that more deaths are likely.

Grandmother Maria Lee, 56, of Radnor Park Crescent, was absolutely distraught after she lost three of her beloved dogs in the space of 24 hours.

Although there is no guaranteed cure for the virus but pet owners are being encouraged to get their dogs vaccinated.

Vet Anthony Barnes, of the Manor Road Clinic, described the horrific and painful way in which the disease kills.</blockquote>
