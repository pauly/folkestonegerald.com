<blockquote>BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe is calling for bands from <a href="/wiki/maidstone">Maidstone</a> and across Kent to get in touch with Radio 1 for the chance to be part of Radio 1's Big Weekend  The Fringe Festival. The Fringe will celebrate the local music scene, from guitar bands through to bedroom DJs, MCs and everything in between. The event takes place in the town in the week preceding Radio 1's Big Weekend. 

Bands can apply by going to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend">bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend</a> where all the details of how to get your band on to the Fringe Festival are explained. 

A panel made up of BBC Kent Introducing presenters James Bursey and Tom Kirkby, Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens, the Radio 1 Live events team and Radio 1 producers will be responsible for selecting the bands to play live at the Fringe.

BBC Kent Introducing will host a night during the Fringe featuring bands selected by the show. From this line-up Huw Stephens will choose his two favourite bands who will go on to play the BBC Introducing stage at Radio 1's Big Weekend.

Please get in touch by April 21st. If you get a slot on the Fringe Festival we will be in touch by April 25th with all the details of your show.</blockquote>
