<blockquote>MAN GRAN HUNTED

POLICE are hunting a man who dresses up as a gran and tries to cuddle to women in Folkestone, Kent.

He is also believed to have posed as a journalist to ask women if he can film them.</blockquote>

Sounds like a prank to me, intended for <a href="/wiki/youtube+internet+video">youtube | internet video</a> type larks rather than anything more sinister, but who knows... It's not me anyway, I promise.
