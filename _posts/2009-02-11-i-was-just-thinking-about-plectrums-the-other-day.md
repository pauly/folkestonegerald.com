found one in the house, think I got it from a <a href="/wiki/darkness">Darkness</a> gig. I used to have tonnes of them from various gigs, but I didn't ever keep track of which one came from which gig. You are lucky, if ever this is a demand for plectrums from <a href="/wiki/big+country">Big Country</a> gigs, you will be in a good position...
