The Fisherman's rest is rubbish and I won't be using that place again, decided to pop in for a drink last weekend (3rd May) with my wife and friends, only to be told very rudely by the Landlord to leave as it was a private function.  The place looked open as usual, with no one stopping you from going in, he made you look as if you had just gate crashed the function. So to all who like a local pub with some atmosphere and friendly staff, avoid the Fisherman's as it's crap.
