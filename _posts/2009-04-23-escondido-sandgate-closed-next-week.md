<a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> are closing again for some work to be done! Will this be the long promised extension into the basement? Can't see it. Anyway it's closed from the 24th to the 1st of May. Best phone if you're planning on going there... Seems odd being closed over the weekend, but I guess it's the pre pay day weekend.

(Walking the streets of <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a> so you don't have to...)
