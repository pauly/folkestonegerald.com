I was at Folkestone 1968 - 1970 I did the pre-dip.  Use to hang out with the dodgy druggy townies..so much for a private education!  Took my Hot Rats album to play at tea break Peaches En Regalia and a great art school trip to Southbank one night to see Frank Zapper - I am sure John Eveliegh was with us all drunk on the train.  I use to have my hair sprayed with pink and orange ink through diffusers...like the album girl - that's how i got the name Candy Floss. Archies for sure, Leas Cliff Hall for Bonzo Dog, dope on the beach, Enoc had d dead tree in his room watching The Devils 3 times round as snowing outside drinking sherry with lemonade arguing with "gorgeous" Aldous why Easy Rider was better than Midnight Cowboy etc etc. Great days..living in a bedsit aged 16 with Enoch upstairs with a dead tree in his room..smoking dope on the beach Little Lynne living on a derelict boat, Squirrel and Caroline - we use to make a right racket..must have driven the staff mad...but I remember it well for all the drugs!
