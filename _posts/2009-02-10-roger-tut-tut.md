Whoever is posting anonymous libellous tales about <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=+cbe+s+roger+de+haan+">"CBE's Roger De Haan"</a> here under the name "true justice cannot be bribed" <b>please stop</b>. If anyone comes after me because of this I do have your account details from BT and I won't hesitate to pass them on if it keeps me out of trouble...
