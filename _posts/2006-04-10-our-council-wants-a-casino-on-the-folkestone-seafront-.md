<blockquote>AN application has been submitted for a casino for Shepway.

The Government's casino advisory panel welcomed proposals from local authorities for regional, large or smaller venues, and on Friday, Shepway District Council put its case for a large casino for the seafront area of Folkestone.

The panel said it would be particularly interested in areas of deprivation, and the district council said the job opportunities and increase in visitors would be of great benefit to the area.

A decision is not expected before the autumn.</blockquote>
