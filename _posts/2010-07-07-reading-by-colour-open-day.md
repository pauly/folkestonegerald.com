Kingsmead school Canterbury 10th July, sorry I missed the Dymchurch one...

<blockquote>The Reading By Colour Charity are holding two open days on the 3rd July at the Dymchurch Primary starting at 10.00 and last registration 1.00 (depending on queue) and Kingsmead school Canterbury 10th July from 9.00 - 3.00 This is free.
We will be running pre-screen sessions with trained Irlen screeners. Things to look... for Reading .........difficulties, lack of concentration, light sensitivity, underachievement, sore eyes, inability to catch a ball and judge distances. Many that have ADHD, Autism, dyscalcular, dyspraxia. Approx 50% of those with Dyslexia have Irlen syndrome Check out the website. www.readingbycolour.org.uk Incidently adults suffer from it too. It can seriously affect driving. It can affect your work. The charity can screen adults but the open day is specifically for the children. Please bring any glasses prescribed with you
Contact us if you have any questions or queries we are here to help...
