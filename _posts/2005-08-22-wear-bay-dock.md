Does anyone know what the dock/landing stage at Wear Bay was used for and when was it built? Somebody told me it was built as a troop embarcation dock in WW1. Looks older to me. Also, what are the remains of the builing and chimney(?) and what look like railway tracks(visable at low tide) at Copt point?
