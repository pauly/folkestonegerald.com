Might have been last week's paper, it was in the "Memories" section though written by <a href="/wiki/mailto+hollingsbee+uk2+net+bob+hollingsbee">mailto:hollingsbee@uk2.net Bob Hollingsbee</a>, you could try contacting him.

I am assured there is a bunker under Waterstones, though there was no mention of this in the article.

I think the article said someone was researching these secret tunnels, maybe they're writing a book?
