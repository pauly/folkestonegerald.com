<blockquote>In the first of a series of Keane announcements, the band are pleased to release their UK tour dates beginning in May 2012. 

This will be their first UK tour in three years, the last of which culminated in two sold out O2 Arena shows.

On finishing the recording of the new album in February Keane announced two special shows at the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill, 

a location close to their hearts as it was both their teenage haunt and near to where the album was recorded. They announced the dates in the local paper only and within 5 minutes they were sold out. This will be the first time fans will hear new material. 

Highly anticipated and years in the making the band recorded the album in the UK at Sea Fog, Ivor Novello Award winner Tim Rice-Oxley's studio and are calling it their most personal record yet. Release details to be announced soon.</blockquote>
