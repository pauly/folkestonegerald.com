I would just like to say that I have just eaten @ 66 and found the food good, as I'm in the catering trade myself I find I am very picky where I eat.The food was cooked well and atmosphere was nice.Ive known Jo for years and have to say I take my hat off to you, and I'm sure your restaurant will get better and better as the months past by.
Regards Mark.
