I don't like how Folkestone seems to be being mentioned alongside other roughneck towns, in being one that's already banned hooded tops in the town centre...

It's not hoodies that are banned though is it, it's YOUTHS, disguising their faces by wearing hoods and hats and then robbing pick and mix from Woolworths.
