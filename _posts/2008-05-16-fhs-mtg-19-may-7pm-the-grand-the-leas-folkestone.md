PLEASE DO COME TO THE GRAND HOTEL ON THE LEAS ON MONDAY MAY 19th AT 7PM.  

Once again Folkestone's history is under threat as developers plan to demolish the Harbour Railway Station, the Station Master's House, the Signal Box and Viaduct in order to build a Marina and University.  Save Folkestone Railway Group are seeking to retain all of this unique example of our engineering heritage.

 For over 165 years, the railway and harbour has served many thousands of travellers both to and from the Continent, and millions of service personnel in two World Wars.  It provided jobs for local people and could still do so.  A fully working harbour and railway would definitely promote regeneration of the area.

 COME ALONG TO THE GRAND, THE LEAS, FOLKESTONE on MAY 19th at 7PM and state your views.  All Welcome. Don't miss the opportunity.
