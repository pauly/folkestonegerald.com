Has anyone been over to the <a href="/wiki/art+exhibition">Art Exhibition</a> at <a href="/wiki/hythe+road">Hythe Road</a>, just off the A20 near to <a href="/wiki/secret+garden+restaurant">Secret Garden Restaurant</a>? There have been a lot of requests for big icon paintings and there is a v.cool BIG canvas of <a href="/wiki/dave+grohl">Dave Grohl</a> in red and brown plus a BIG Dirty Harry painting, along with a smaller Marmite painting which looks really funky in the kitchen. There are also various Folkestone scenes as shown here on the fab FG site. If anyone wants to commission a painting, let us know at <a href="http://www.ezeetiger.com">ezeetiger.com</a> but take a look at the ready made pics at the Courtyard Gallery, Hythe Road if you want some inspiration! Any questions, leave here or refer to the ezeetiger website. Happy Christmas all. . .
