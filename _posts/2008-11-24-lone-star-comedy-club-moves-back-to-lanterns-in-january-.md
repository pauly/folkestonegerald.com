Update from Lone Star Comedy, rah they're moving back into the town centre! We can go, and we can walk home!

<blockquote>New Venue: We are delighted to announce that in January we will move the monthly show back to our spiritual home, the Lanterns in Folkestone Town Centre.

Located above Mustangs and the Folkestone Snooker Club (close to Wetherspoons) the Lanterns is being totally refurbished and will provide a superb new venue for the comedy club.  We will be able to offer table service throughout the evening and food!

Other stuff:

Folkestone Foundation and Lonestar will be putting together a Comedy Festival in 2009  - watch out for details (we will send them to you!)

We will be putting together a number of one off events throughout 2009 at various venues  watch out for details (we will send them to you!)</blockquote>
