That sounds a bit quicker than I'd heard before, but <a href="http://www.propertyinvesting.net/content/specialreport-folkestone.htm">so says propertyinvesting.net</a>... it also adds:

<blockquote>Folkestone is a nice town generally  no really bad areas. Down by the harbour it's got "further to go" than other parts of the town. Much of Folkestone is large elegant Victoriana  three story terraces many in leafy avenues. Any property with sea-views will command a premium in future years... Close to the town centre is a plus if you rent your property. There is no University*, but there is a town centre International Language College that needs student accommodation. Price are rising fast  from last October, so get in quick before it's too late!</blockquote>

What a nice report!

*and surely there will be a uni of some description soon enough!
