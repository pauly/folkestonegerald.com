Hmm got emailed this today and thought "I recognise that chap", he used to work at <a href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk">our place</a>. Read the whole press release though, have you any idea what the business is? The accompanying pictures show our Dan stood next to a painted lady (literally, a lady with paint on her) but I still can't work it out.

YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR SECURES LOCAL SUPPORT 
DEATAILS:  Young Folkestone businessman, Dan Catt, has found his way around the Monopoly Board of becoming a successful entrepreneur with his promotions business "Pure Body Promotions". 

Although he has only just started Dan, aged 20, has gained the support of a number of local organisation that support his type of initiative. 

Dan visited the young people's information centre, C@fe IT on Grace Hill in Folkestone, to find out how he could go about starting his own business.   There he met Kent County Council Youth Worker, Steve Chambers, who advised Dan to contact The Kent Foundation. 

Dan is now undertaking a Test Trading scheme with The Kent Foundation.  Dan gets financial support for twelve weeks during which time he will be testing and promoting his service throughout Kent.  

The Kent Foundation Director, Paul Barron, said: 

"We aim to support young people with the potential to become successful entrepreneurs.  We cannot do this alone though,  Dan is also obtaining advice and support from Enterprise Gateway, part of Business Link in Kent, and I hope he will get involved with other organisations such as the Kent Association of Young Entrepreneurs (KAYE) with whom we have a great link.    This network of support ensures young people get the best chance they can to succeed."

Can I secure some local support from these people? I'm only 36!
