but the posters advertising for people to work at <a href="/wiki/costa+coffee+costa">Costa Coffee | Costa</a> (the only clue that it will be a <a href="/wiki/costa+coffee">Costa Coffee</a> have VANISHED? Is this to be like the <a href="/wiki/starbucks+starbucks+saga">Starbucks | Starbucks saga</a> - first mention of rumours of the store online and everyone backs away..? I hope not.
