<blockquote>We have compiled a new email list for our Open Mic Night. If you wish to be taken off the mailing list just let us know. Alternatively you may forward this email to your friends if you wish...

Welcome to Open Mic Night @ The Chambers. There's been some great, talented performers here over the years. We offer a 16 track desk with full effects, good P.A, a decent monitor so you can hear yourself, a sound engineer that sits at the desk making sure you sound great (and if necessary that people listen!) and a warm atmosphere.

The Open Mic is hosted upstairs in the Coffee Shop which has excellent acoustics. There's a full bar downstairs with a great selection of ales.

Don't worry if you're a novice or if you're nervous. Plenty of people come here to play for the very first time. We're not perfectionists! We've had many different instruments and genre of performance too.

It's a relaxed evening for ALL...we hope you enjoy it and if you do...tell your friends.

A list is usually formed during the evening...if you wish to play at a certain time or have any special requirements please contact us on the number below...</blockquote>
