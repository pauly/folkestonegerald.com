Was not the best we have encountered, we had trouble finding it, then had to arrange parking.  Our room was very dated, and small, no towels supplied, cracked basin, dowdy room decor (brown and black).  Bed was comfortable but we were woken up at four thirty by delivery and bin lorries.  Had to put the kettle on the floor by the bed to boil it.
No bedside cabinet or shelves.
