Yep, Trivium are definately heavy.

There is a fair bit of singing still though, which is really ace as Matt Heafy has a fantastic voice. I'm really looking forward to the gig :)

Everyone should check out the Road Runner United/Allstars album if you havent already.

Especially track 5 - The End, if you are interested in Matt Heafy.
