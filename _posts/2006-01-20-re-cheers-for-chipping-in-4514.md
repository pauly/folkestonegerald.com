The last time I went it was a weird hotel bar/restaurant thing - this was years ago and I've never been back since. There used to be a gig venue/bar that everyone (I say everyone, I mean me and the crowd I hung out with) went most Saturdays called Bottoms, behind The Leas near where the underground car park is now. The other place we always went was a basement bar called Allsorts that used to stay open until all hours and be run in a speakeasy type fashion. That's gone now because it was under one of the houses that were opposite the Rotunda that got knocked down.
