Anchor Baby Recordings is a professional digital recording service, based in a beautiful studio, set in its own peaceful garden in Monks Horton, just outside of Folkestone in Kent. The studio was lovingly purpose-built in 1989 and has seen bands such as AC/DC and Wishbone Ash walk through its doors over the years.

I have been recording for 8 or 9 years, working with various setups and in various studios and have perfected the art of capturing raw energy and moments that tend to get lost on a lot of modern records. I'm a touring musician myself, so can relate to bands on both sides of the glass.

Please visit www.myspace.com/anchorbabyrecordings for pictures, information on the studio and my musical background, MP3s and more.
