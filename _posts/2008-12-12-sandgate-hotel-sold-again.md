<a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald+the+herald">Folkestone Herald | The Herald</a> reports that it's been sold again, they're guessing for 900k this time, wonder if the new owners will be able to make a go of it. I hope so, it's a nice place. It's not <a href="/wiki/gordon+ramsay">Gordon Ramsay</a> who's bought it, hope the new owners don't have another kitchen nightmare.
