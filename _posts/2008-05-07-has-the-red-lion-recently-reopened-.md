I just heard today that the Red Lion has been closed for the past three months, and is all spanking new after a major refit and cleanup. I've been avoiding that place for a long time, obviously long enough not to notice it'd be out of action for that long, but do you know what? I'm going to revisit it this weekend! I hope it's good.
