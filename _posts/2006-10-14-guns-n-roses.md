F**kin' Mega Performance from the Skids
G'n'R weren't bad
Nine inch nails were pony (if I remember correctly, gettin' old now mate)

See G'n'R the following year 13.06.92 at Wembley Stadium with Soundgarden and Faith no more
Soundgarden done it for me with an excellent Jesus Christ Pose performance
