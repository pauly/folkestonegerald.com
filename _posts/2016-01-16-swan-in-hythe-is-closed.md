Closed for renovation according to the sign, I wonder if it will reopen? It's been up for sale for a while according to <a href="/wiki/camra">CAMRA</a>. It's right on the high street, so not ripe for turning into houses I wouldn't have thought like most threatened pubs.

If it's really just closed for renovation then January - aka <a href="/wiki/dryanuary">dryanuary</a> - is a clever time to do it. I'm feeling a bit bad for <a href="/wiki/not+drinking">not drinking</a> this month, seems the <a href="/wiki/micropub">micropub</a>s and the small brewers really need my help. I try and do my best during <a href="/wiki/febrewery">Febrewery</a>.
