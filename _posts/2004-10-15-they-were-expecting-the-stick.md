Well they must have been, that's the kind of band they are... seeing them again next Friday at London Astoria...

If you have any photos or particular remeniscences about any of those gigs, you could post them up, and if there are any in your ticket stub collection that I've missed, please try and add them... and tell other people about the site! It's quite new, I want to turn it into a bit of a resource now I am living in Folkestone.
