Some gig history stuff from <a href="http://www.mrgig.com">mrgig.com</a>; DrGavin says
<blockquote>I've heard that <a href="/wiki/ramones">The Ramones</a> wrote <a href="/wiki/i+wanna+be+sedated">I Wanna Be Sedated</a> backstage at a venue in Canterbury (can't remember which one) and that <a href="/wiki/judge+dread">Judge Dread</a> literally died on stage at the <a href="/wiki/penny+theatre">Penny Theatre</a></blockquote>
