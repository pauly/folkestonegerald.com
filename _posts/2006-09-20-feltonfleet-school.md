<blockquote>Does anyone know anything about the Princes Hotel, Radnor (Executive) Club, Folkestone Trained Nurses' Institute, Athelstan School, Feltonfleet School and does anyone have any pictures/correspondence links to where I can lay my hands on historical stuff on either/both of them?</blockquote>
There's a Princes Hotel in Eastbourne and a Princes Marine Hotel in Hove,  both a bit far to be of any use though. There is a Princes Parade in Hythe, if that might be a clue... What info do you have on any of these businesses / institutions already?

I see <a href="http://www.family-tree.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=2386&sid=e527027f8a1c62b6e7523bad53de7728">your post on family-tree.co.uk</a>, where were these schools then? Were any of them on <a href="/wiki/earls+avenue">Earls Avenue</a>? What was the name of the school that was where "Old School Court" (flats) is now? Or where you on The Leas where <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1954/Southcliff+Hotel">The Southcliff Hotel</a> is now?

I see some responses to <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060824024421AAHqjel">a question (your question?) on Yahoo Answers</a>:

<blockquote><b>What happened to Feltonfleet School in Folkestone?</b>

Feltonfleet School was founded in 1903 in Folkestone and remained there until 1916 when it moved to Surrey. However, my father attended the school in 1932, but according to <a href="http://www.feltonfleet.co.uk">feltonfleet.co.uk</a> the school didn't exist in Folkestone at that time. In 1944 the school was demolished by a V1 and the destruction was reported in the local paper. What's going on?
