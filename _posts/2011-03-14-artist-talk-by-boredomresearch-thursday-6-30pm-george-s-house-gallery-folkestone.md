<blockquote>Collaborating as boredomresearch, Southampton based Vicky Isley and Paul Smith have gained an international reputation for interrogating the creative role of computing. boredomresearch often think of themselves as employing computer gaming technology to create landscape paintings and life studies that move. Many of their works have been created using modelling techniques similar to those used by scientists to study naturally occurring phenomena. However their aim is to create something new of intrigue and beauty.

Currently they are both Research Lecturers in Computer Animation & Computer Art at the National Centre of Computer Animation, Bournemouth University UK. They are represented by [DAM] Berlin and are ArtsSway Associates.

boredomresearch will talk about their portfolio of projects including the works currently in Georges House Gallery - RealSnailMail and newly comissioned AspirationStorm .  They will discuss their approach to creating engaging digital artworks, how they develop themes and cross boundaries between science, art and technology. All their artwork is computer generated and includes interactive artworks, public artworks, online projects/environments, prints and generative objects which have been shown both nationally and internationally.

Places are free but limited, so please call 01303 244533 or email diane@strangecargo.org.uk to book your place. Please let anyone know about the talk who you think would be interested in coming along.
