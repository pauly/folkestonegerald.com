Hi Trevor
Thanks for your message, this isn't a sight i would usually go on so it would be better to take your email address really. Yes I do remember you and I am sure its you in this picture that sue sent me a short while ago. How did your reunion go with your old ship mates? It must be odd to meet up again as you sort of expect them to look the same.
Thats impressive having your work at the Mall Gallery, do you manage to sell many?
No I don't live in London anymore, we moved to Sussex, near Haywards Heath, about 18 years ago, so I don't go to London too often now.

Best Wishes
Lorna
