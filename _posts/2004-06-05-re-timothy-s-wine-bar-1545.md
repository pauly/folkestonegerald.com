Reading your article has offended me, but you should know that if you publish facts you should be accurate.
1. Sussanna was a chef in spain
2. Tim did not want seafood in the paella as he said the customers in Folkestone did not like sea food or fish when he was taking bookings.
3. The beef was cooked in the NORTHERN style,not in the southern style,CARNE ASADA inglesa
4. The only people that complain were your group
5. If you go to a restaurant in London the sangria would cost 25 
6. We were trying to help tim out we made no charge
 I am sorry if you did not like the meal but i hope that i dont see you in my restaurant in London
Yours sincerely
