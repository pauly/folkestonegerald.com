A Folkestone writer and artist have made a book on mythical and literary books, from the pegasus and the Minotaur to vampires and Frankenstein's Monster. A less than serious version this book is written by <a href="/wiki/paul+wimsett">Paul Wimsett</a> and illustrated by <a href="/wiki/anne+wimsett">Anne Wimsett</a>. It is available at <a href="http://books.lulu.com/content/1868554">books.lulu.com/content/1868554</a> or e-mail Paul at plwimsett@yahoo.co.uk or Anne at awimsett@yahoo.co.uk.

Thank you.
