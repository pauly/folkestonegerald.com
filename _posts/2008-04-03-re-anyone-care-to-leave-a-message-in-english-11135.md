Ok.. the <a href="/wiki/orient+express">Orient Express</a> trundled into the Harbour station this afternoon, which was a surprise as I was led to believe the final visit was in November 2007?

On that subject, the penultimate visit(?) of the <a href="/wiki/golden+arrow">Golden Arrow</a> steam train will take place this Saturday (5th). Make the most of it!
