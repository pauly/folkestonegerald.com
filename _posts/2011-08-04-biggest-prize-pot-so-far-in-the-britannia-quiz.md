First prize was an astounding 27, that's nearly as good as the thirteen grand plus that us up for grabs on <a href="/wiki/pointless">Pointless</a> right now. Did not seem like the pub was that full to me, was a very hot day so not heaving when we arrived, I didn't think the prize would be much but it was the best one I've seen I think.

I'm too modest to say just who won, but I'd like to offer my congratulations to the teams who came in second and third. Ahem.

Because of holidays and things, we won't be there for the next three weeks, so please feel free to take our place. I think the next three dinners are curry, sausages, and lasagne (probably not all at once).
