Watching <a href="/wiki/coach+trip">Coach Trip</a> at the weekend, Brendan mentioned driving his 2CV around <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> when he lived here. When was that, anyone out there know him? In my mind he was a guide for <a href="/wiki/saga">SAGA</a> or something, but anyone know for sure?

I love <a href="/wiki/coach+trip">Coach Trip</a>.
