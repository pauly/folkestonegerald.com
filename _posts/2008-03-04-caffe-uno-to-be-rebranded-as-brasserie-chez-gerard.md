[all details deleted at the request of the person who emailed me - perhaps it's a secret?]

We went to <a href="/wiki/caffe+uno">Caffe Uno</a> <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> for the first time on Saturday and <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/11055/11055/Caffe+Uno+bit+poor">it was not good</a>, I hope this rebranding is an extensive overhaul.
