Hi, this site isn't connected with any of the organisers whose events are listed here, but I'd try contacting some of the venues directly who've hosted murder mystery dinners and so on, like <a href="/wiki/hythe+imperial">Hythe Imperial</a> or <a href="/wiki/tim+s+tapas">Tim's Tapas</a> or <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2832/Bar+Vasa">Bar Vasa</a> and see who they used. Good luck and have a good birthday.
