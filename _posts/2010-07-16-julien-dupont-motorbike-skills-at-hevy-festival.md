I hope he's goign to jump over some rhinos or something:

<blockquote>Motorbike freestyle trials pioneer Julien Dupont will give a taster of his incredible skills across a specially constructed set-up, built especially for the Hevy Music Festival 2010 by sports titans Red Bull.

Plus - 8 more bands complete this year's line-up.</blockquote>

I love Red Bull motorbike stunt stuff, sounds good...
