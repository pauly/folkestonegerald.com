<blockquote>Sellindge Music Festival is happening on 7th & 8th June 2008 at Hope Farm, Gibbons Brook, Nr Ashford, Kent, England, TN25 6HH. See you there!</blockquote>

40 for the weekend, so cheaper than most festivals, and it ought to have a proper indie vibe, but the lineup is not that strong, and there are a lot of other festivals out there... Good luck to you, send me some free tickets if you want me to say something nicer, I'd come along!

Headliners <a href="/wiki/idlewild">Idlewild</a> and <a href="/wiki/mark+morris">Mark Morris</a> an' t'ing, I can't copy and paste the rest from <a href="http://www.sellindgemusicfestival.co.uk/music.php">the official Sellindge festival lineup</a> as it's all images, so <a href="http://www.sellindgemusicfestival.co.uk/music.php">go there and check it out</a>.
