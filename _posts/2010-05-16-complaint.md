I just want to say how very very dissapointed at the lack of advertiseing for the rescent garage saffari,we had paid are money,expecting it to be not un like capel,there was only a small sign up white horse hill,which was put up friday,saturday,no big signs,no newspaper advertiseing,we had a sign on the fence with flags an ballons,people said if it wasnt for that they would,nt have known,they had said it was very poor organisatoin,there was hardly any local people,as they didnt no anything about it,it a great idea,shame there wasnt more put into the ADVERTISEING,we had people who turned up from dartford who saw it on the internet,but couldnt find were to get map,they just happen to see are sign on the fence,we had put so much effort in to are sell,cakes an plants,which always sell well,plus loads bric a brac, ect,PLEASSSSE next time if more effort was put in on the advertiseing,it would be GREAT FOR EVERYONE,even local radio advertiseing.
    THE UNHAPPY SELLERS AT 78,80 THE STREET
