I have now been to this restaurant 3 times. The food is cooked but all of it is really smoothered in a sauce of one kind or another. One of my friends that was with me the other day commented that when they cook Sardines in France they just grill them, they don't put sauce all over them. The Chef replied well i like sauces.
