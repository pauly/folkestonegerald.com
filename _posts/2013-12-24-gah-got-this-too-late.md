So had to run to the tip today to get our <a href="/wiki/recycling">recycling</a> down to a manageable level before we start all the <a href="/wiki/christmas">christmas</a> unwrapping... Lots of neighbours missed it too, and put their bins out this morning in that hooley (weather still shocking, proper gale force) so their bins ended up in other peoples gardens and I don't know where all the <a href="/wiki/rubbish">rubbish</a> went. It was blowing to the West so it's probably gone down Seabrook Road to Hythe...
