Haven't had a restaurant review here in a while, so instead I will plug where I am going tonight - <a href="http://www.mildreds.co.uk">Mildreds</a>. No idea what it will be like, but as it's all vegetarian, I think there's going to be more choice for me than the average Folkestone restaurant... Check out their menu online, and maybe take some inspiration from it if you have a menu of your own.
