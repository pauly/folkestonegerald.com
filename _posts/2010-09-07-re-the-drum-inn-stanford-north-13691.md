hello Julie what the person who wrote that pack of lies above don't mention is is that they are in local copetion with The Drum and see them as a threat. The Drum is a Pub with a food outlet as most pubs are nowadays food qaulity is very high and prices are very reasonable. The biggest problem with all these type of web sites is there is no contril over what is put on them (true or false) and if you dont know the local pub why not walk in and make your own mind up for yourself.

Regards Mick
