I knew I recognised the picture of the landlord on one of the websites promoting the opening of <a href="/wiki/potting+shed">Potting Shed</a> in <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a>, it's him and her from <a href="/wiki/britannia">The Britannia</a> on <a href="/wiki/horn+street">Horn Street</a>. So I guess that means they are no longer there?

The Potting Shed was previously a cafe / bistro and now it's a nice <a href="/wiki/micropub">micropub</a>, half a dozen barrels behind the bar and some seating. I met some local <a href="/wiki/camra">CAMRA</a> members in there which was nice, I will try and get along to the next of their gatherings.

I look forward to my next visit!
