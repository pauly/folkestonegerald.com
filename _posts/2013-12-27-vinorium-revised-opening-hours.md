<blockquote>When will The Vinorium open after the long deserved Christmas & New Year break?

We are looking forward to welcoming you back at 11am on Friday 10th January 2014.


What is changing?

We have enormous plans for The Vinorium in the New Year... Firstly, we hope to establish our own smallholding of livestock - Highland cattle, rare breed pigs (The Middle White, Gloucester Old Spot to name a few) and sheep as we wish to produce food for you with assured provenance and quality (exactly what we search out with our wine). 

We have been thinking about ways in which we can transform the ordinary (we firmly believe we are much better than the 'ordinary') into extraordinary. We believe we must work towards mastering our crafts. By thinking of ourselves as craftsmen, we can think of our work as our art and with this philosophy at the forefront of our thinking, some our staff will be sent off to spend time with other professional establishments in the hope that their new found knowledge will be shared and experienced with you, our customers. 

We must also find a new home for our Gin Distillery and we are on the lookout for a new wine shop and restaurant at another location in Kent. Given the enormous task in hand, we thought we would take advantage of the winter quietness and revise our opening hours as follows (please be assured we will be back to a 5-6 day week towards the latter part of Spring).

Monday - Closed
Tuesday - Closed
Wednesday - Closed
Thursday - Closed
Friday - 11.00am - 10.00pm
Saturday - 10.00am - 10.00pm
Sunday - 10.00am - 4.00pm

Wishing you all a super Christmas and a truly fabulous New Year!

Cheers,
Stuart & Team Vinorium
