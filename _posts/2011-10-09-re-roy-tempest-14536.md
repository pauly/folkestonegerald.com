Silver surfing yesteryear like you do wondering what became of people that were part of your life 
i find someone who used to work for Roy Tenpest !
as i did ....but later than you and remember Lorna too....small world...i worked as a tour manager for the visiting american acts from 1968 to 1970 but had
to use my own car !
a Rogue is a kind word to describe him all the issues were over money and he always claimed he had none !!
