Now some confusion has been cleared up for me, there are two of these <a href="http://www.youtube.com">youtube.com</a> copyist sites around at the moment, both just launched at the same time, <a href="http://www.kenttv.com">kenttv.com</a> launched by the council and run in some way by <a href="/wiki/bob+geldof">Bob Geldof</a>, and also <a href="http://www.yourkenttv.co.uk">yourkenttv.co.uk</a>, run by the Kent on Sunday people, who also do all those free papers they're handing out at the moment, <a href="/wiki/your+shepway">Your Shepway</a>, <a href="/wiki/your+canterbury">Your Canterbury</a>, <a href="/wiki/your+dover">Your Dover</a> and so on...
