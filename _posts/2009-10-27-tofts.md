puJust like to add my memories of Tofts. Went there throughout the flower power era with the ultra-violet lights and the incense sticks which filled the air. It was open all summer with local groups but of course the big acts we all remember most such as Geno ,Freddy Mack , Amboy Dukes  -hey even Bill Haley and Junior Walker. What about that great Geranium Pond and the ska bands such as The Bees. 
        No bar ,but you learned to drink quick in the interval. I think the guy's memory of a 100 capacity was a bit off---I was told it was about 600. Is the building still intact internally or has it changed beyond recognition? I remember Harold and Doris and have still got a lot of the discs they played and it only takes one incense stick to bring it all back.
