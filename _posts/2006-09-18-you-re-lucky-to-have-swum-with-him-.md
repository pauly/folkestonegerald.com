I'm sure I heard he's a bottlenose dolphin, now you and he are such close chums you should probably <a href="http://stores.ebay.co.uk/sandgatedolphin2006">get the t-shirt</a>... I swam with dolphins in Florida, at a conservation centre, they told us there not to approach them in the wild, but this one does seem friendly. I don't think they're common enough over here for their to be clubs organising swims with them. Head to Florida!
