Hi,
   I was really impressed with your interactive map and they way in which you managed to get it to filter.  How easy is it to do something like that and doesn't google complain?!
   I am actually interested in doing something similar for my site.  I hope you don't mind if I ask a few questions...

How is the data inputed for the filtering? 
Is it done through google (i.e. are the properties able to be found doing the right google map search)?
Is the filtering information easy to maintain on mass? For example, if half of those properties were sold, how long would it take to update the map?

I would love to hear how you did it!
