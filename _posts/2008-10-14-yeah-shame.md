7k a month is not a lot of profit though I don't think for a place that size. Did not realise it was owned by a brewery, are you sure? I think it was independent.

I heard the owners were scuppered after being fined for cutting down a tree, or something like that, but I can find no mention of such a tale googling.

Their portions were big, and the service was a bit grouchy at times, but I quite liked it. The food did not seem fresh cooked to order, but it was excellent pub food rather than fine dining anyway. Big portions and good beer too, mmm.

So where do we go now?
