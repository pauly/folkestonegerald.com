<a href="http://www.jiwire.com/wi-fi-wireless-hotspot-folkestone-gb-wetherspoons-1048260.htm">It says here</a> that the <a href="/wiki/wetherspoons">Wetherspoons</a> is a <a href="/wiki/folkestone+wireless+hotspot">Folkestone wireless hotspot</a>, the only public one apparently... unless anyone knows of any more?

I'll be setting up my own <a href="/wiki/wireless+hotspot">wireless hotspot</a> soon enough in the <a href="/wiki/west+end">West End</a>, but will hopefully be keeping it locked down!
