There's very little info online actually, <a href="http://www.lcrhq.co.uk">lcrhq.co.uk</a> might have info on the high speed rail link, AFAIK still not due until the end of 2009, and that's not allowing for any new postponements. I made the move from London with all this in mind though.

The squabbles between Roger DeHaan and Jimmy Godden are all over now I think, they did a big property trade off and Mr DeHaan owns all the seafront land he needs to continue with the master plan. I think <a href="http://www.folkestoneharbour.com">folkestoneharbour.com</a> will have more info on this.

There really are a lot of flats in Folkestone at the moment, so many that it's stopping the prices rising I think, but I'm not property expert! I have bought one flat, to live in, and seen a rise of somewhere between 20 and 40% in the past three years. The two years before I bought, values in our block rose 100% in two years. I'm keeping this flat after I buy my next place as I think Folkestone will be great int he long term, especially if the university plans all come off.

A place with a sea view sounds a good bet, plenty of those around here, though a garage or parking space will be of value too.

Please report back with anything you discover! It's not a terribly lively forum, but I'll help out with whatever info I can.
