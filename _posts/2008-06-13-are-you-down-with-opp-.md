The excellent [google=other people's photographs folkestone]Other People's Photographs[/google] project has been absorbed into some Channel 4 project and is putting their name to <a href="http://www.opp2.org">opp2.org</a>. Only two pictures posted there from Folkestone, no actual connection with the OPP project as far as I can see so far. I will post <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/10164/10164/Folkestone+earthquake%21">my picture</a>, that the <a href="http://www.strangecargo.org.uk/">Strange Cargo</a> people used for the project, only seen it on the interactive cashpoint type setup so far though, not on an actual street sign.

Again this is from a freesheet, they say there's an exhibtion of the photos at the "St George's Gallery", I think it's called George's House though. Will go there tomorrow and check it out.
