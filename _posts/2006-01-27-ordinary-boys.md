<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/17003C33E7A94042?affiliate=POPE">Get Ordinary Boystickets here</a> or stroll down there a bit sharpish, with all this Big Brother stuff going on these will sell out fast. There will be more girls in the audience than usual for a Folkestone gig I guess! Delirious-question-mark are coming too, just confirmed. Christian Rock, loving it. I went to a show of theirs at Shepherds Bush Empire once, the weirdest crowd EVER.
