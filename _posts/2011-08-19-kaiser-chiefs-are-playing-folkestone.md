<blockquote><a href="/wiki/kaiser+chiefs">Kaiser Chiefs</a>

We are very pleased to announce that the Kaiser Chiefs will be playing the Leas Cliff Hall as part of their first UK tour in almost two years.

The 2012 tour follows the band's re-emergence this year with new album 'The Future Is Medieval', a host of UK festival appearances including a euphoric return to Glastonbury, V Festival, two huge sold out shows at Leeds' Kirkstall Abbey and some superlative shows on the European festival circuit.
