Hi, thought I would let you know we are now opening on Sunday evenings for drinks, bar snacks and live music. Hope you can make it!


Sunday Sessions kick off on 18th October with Dulcie May Moreno - People's Music Awards nominee - Best female.

Stripped to the bone sultry and soulful, Dulcie May is perfect for lounging on hazy Sunday afternoons with a jazz woodbine over the Sunday papers. Ignoring the lessons learned after Charles Manson she claims to have hippy friends and comes from Guildford, though she more than makes up for this with her breathy organic and sultry tones. She takes her musical cues from Nina Simone, John Martyn and Tracy Chapman with the aim of reaching deep into the river of your soul.

We will be open for drinks and traditional bar snacks inspired by our new Autumn menu from 6pm-11pm.

For more details or to book a table call 01303 259 535 or email info@numberelevenfolkestone.co.uk.
