<blockquote>We have just opened a new Jazz Bar and Restaurant at the top of the Creative Quarter, 11-15 The Old High Street, Folkestone, Kent CT20 1RL
 
We are called Totally Jazz
 
And offer a great menu and variety of Jazz bands from Scarlett Rae to the Jazz Police
 
We would love to have all our "gig"s featured on your site. </blockquote>
