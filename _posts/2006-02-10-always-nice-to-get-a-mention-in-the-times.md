<a href="http://tls.timesonline.co.uk">Times Literary Supplement</a> this time no less, <a href="http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25339-2030841,00.html">a review</a> of <a href="/wiki/dj+taylor+s+victorian+mystery+kept">DJ Taylor's Victorian Mystery, Kept</a>, set at least partly in Folkestone. Not such a great review as it goes.
