Timothys may have had some teething problems, but is now one of the best venues in Folkestone. I always get a warm and friendly welcome and the recent addition of a large choice of Tapas dishes are excellent.
If you would like to learn more about wine, or just have a great night I recommend the regular wine tasting events, which are always fully booked.
