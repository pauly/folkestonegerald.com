Hi Haveing looked for Lambert and Weston , I read that the firm was taken over and no longer bears the name wich was carried on by sucsessive persons who bought the buisness , although there are exibitions of  his work , and the firm name was still being used in 1968 and 1969 as i have photos taken at shorncliffe marked with the company name, from my military days .
