Just been to our first Literary Festival event of this year, Susie Dent, very good though there were a few technical issues. If you're going to David Starkey say, and think you might want to get a book signed by him, why not <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Henry-Virtuous-Prince-David-Starkey/dp/0007247710/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225650539&sr=8-">order it from Amazon</a> and take it along? A massive 50% saving if you do! A little credit crunch tip for you, thank me when you see me...
