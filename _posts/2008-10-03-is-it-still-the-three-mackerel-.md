<a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/67/The+Three+Mackeral">It</a> has had more names than that in just the few years I've been here, it seems jinxed... It was <a href="/wiki/nostalgia+bar">Nostalgia Bar</a> a fifties themed bar just before it was <a href="/wiki/euphoria">Euphoria</a> I think. I've only liked one of the incarnations in recent years, when it had the hexagonal pool table, <a href="/wiki/front">The Front</a> I think, but that closed about the time I moved here. At least it's still open (if it is still open) so many pubs locally are closing.

Good to hear you came back, sorry to hear it was for a funeral.
