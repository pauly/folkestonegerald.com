Can i just first of all the review that you gave Timothy's is very unfair and that you should never slag a place off with going there once.

If do intend to keep having visits to your site i suggest a more decent approach to the reviews and that you let people make up there own mind rather that blast them with your view every two seconds!!!!

Personally i love Timothys and the people that make it what it is. There's nowhere else in Folkestone where you will find a more friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Also you get no trouble like a number of places i could name but won't....

P.S It would help also with your review if you learnt how to spell.
