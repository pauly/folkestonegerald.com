Hey guys,

Just a message to promote my recording studio:

It's called Barewires, and is a purpose-built recording studio situated in Monks Horton. The studio was formerly known as Astra Audio and over the years has seen the likes of AC/DC and Wishbone Ash walk through its doors.

The studio is very large, set in its own peaceful garden and hosts a huge array of vintage and modern equipment, from a Hammond B3 with 145 Leslie cabinet to a Kiam grand piano and plenty more.

Please check out www.barewires-studio.com or www.myspace.com/danlucas for some information on the studio and my musical background.
