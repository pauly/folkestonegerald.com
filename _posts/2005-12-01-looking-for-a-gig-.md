Got this from <a href="http://www.gigdealer.com">gigdealer.com</a>, sounds like a reasonable idea for the local type bands... 

The <a href="http://www.gigdealer.com">gigdealer.com</a> is a new "gig-exchange-website" for bands and musicians, wich helps you and your band to play more live concerts in new cities / locations and to reach new fans!

Most of us dont have a big fat major deal or the support of a professionel booking-agency: So its time to help yourself and work together with the gigdealer-bands!

And so it works:...

1) You organize a concert (gig) for your band and tell the location-owner that youll bring one (or more) support-bands with you.

2) You put in the gig in our database and the other gigdealer-bands will send you an Application for the place as your support-band!

3) You choose one (or more) bands and in response, youll play the support at the next gig from your guest-bands in their city / country or wherever!

So in this case...

- each of you organize just 1 gig, but youll play 2 (or more) !!!
- youll play in locations where you would not have played without the assistance from the other band !!!
- youll play in front of a new audience and maybe you can win them as new fans (or groopies :-) for your band !!!

And the best thing: you work together with another active and open minded gigdealer-band!!!
