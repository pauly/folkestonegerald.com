I'm looking for help online with a puzzle that a friend at work has set, it relates to a famous grave and plaque in Folkestone somewhere. No joy yet, but I did find <a href="http://www.folkestonetc.kentparishes.gov.uk/userfiles/File/NEWSUMMER2008.pdf">this PDF of Folkestone Town Crier</a> (the newsletter of the town council). It has a crossword with these clues:
<blockquote>Across:
1) Which famous Seamen's Friend is buried in St Martins Grave? (8)
2) He played British Agent Harry Palmer in the Ipcress File. (5)
3) Don't wait up for this smooth talking charmer. (11)
4) Who was <a href="/wiki/jimi+hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>'s Bass player? (4)
5) This member of a famous banking family lived here in 1815. (10)
6) Whose plaque is mounted in <a href="/wiki/albion+villas">Albion Villas</a>? (7)
Down:
1) Who was "Just Good Friends" with Jan Francis? (12)
7) Who was the creator of Frankenstein that took up residence in Folkestone in 1830?(11)
8) He played a cameo role in the Italian Job with 2 across. (10)
9) This writer found it murder on the Orient Express(6)
10) This actor was "<a href="/wiki/to+the+manor+born">To the Manor Born</a>". (5)
11) Carry on Matron. (6)

Even more interestingly it says the las quiz was won by <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=heather+mills">Heather Mills</a>.
