In 1996 I had the marvelous idea of going down a pub to check on a band called Ronnie Scott's Rejects.

Hey, these guys should be world touring !!

Thank you Ronnie Scott's for your phenomenal presentation ! I wish you had a DVD already ! Specially now that I'm living in the U.S. so away from those pubs...
