They're calling it a warm up, tickets are 25! Guess they have to stump up a lot to get a big name like that to appear at a small new venue... Friday 22nd May, get in quick if I was you. Hmm, our baby is due that weekend, think we can still go?

<blockquote>Michael's brilliantly engaging delivery and effortless rapport with the audience have led to him to be hailed as the best new stand up to emerge in a decade and has earned him a sell-out DVD, countless television appearances and an upcoming BBC ONE series, "Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow".

In preparation for his 30 date UK arena tour this autumn, Michael will perform a number of warm-up gigs around the country this spring and summer and we are delighted to be welcoming him to Quarterhouse.</blockquote>

Quarterhouse? CHEESEGRATER, surely, don't they know the name of their own venue?
