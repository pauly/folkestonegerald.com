Time really does fly between the opportunities I get to leave the house and go to the pub. Went through Sandgate the other night and noticed <a href="/wiki/providence">The Providence</a> was closed. I remember it being up for sale, the long term landlord <a href="/wiki/john+latchford">John Latchford</a> was retiring or something, could no longer make a go of the pub. The sale seems to have happened in September <a href="/misc/gigography/2013/">2013</a>, so eighteen months ago!

The Providence was bought by <a href="/wiki/billy+nutt">Billy Nutt</a> with all sorts of showbiz connections, oh yes he was going to bring his friends from <a href="/wiki/eastenders">Eastenders</a> down, as also claimed by another pub operator in the area. Billy Nutt did indeed deliver though, or at least formalise the arrangement, I remember seeing an evening with "Charlie from Eastenders" advertised.

<a href="/wiki/billy+nutt">Billy Nutt</a> has now been jailed for <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/landlord-and-singer-jailed-for-33775/">indecently assaulting a four year old boy</a>. None of his showbiz friends were available to keep the bar open.

I wonder if it will recover? It's always struggled in comparisons with <a href="/wiki/ship">The Ship</a> just a few doors down...
