We'll see... I hate the town centre, and I hate that my kids drag me into <a href="/wiki/debenhams">Debenhams</a> as they think it is a nice place to have lunch. Without <a href="/wiki/debenhams">Debenhams</a> what does it have left though? That bit of town should be abandoned and turned back to nature, introduce deer and wild boar or something. Bears.
