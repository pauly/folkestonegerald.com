So <a href="http://www.kent.gov.uk/libraries">kent.gov.uk/libraries</a> is down right now, but <a href="http://www.kent.gov.uk/LibrariespublicUI/OpeningTimes/LibraryDetails.aspx?id=32">this works</a> if you direct to our library page... Come on, get fixing, it's not like it's a lovely night to be out somewhere or anything!
