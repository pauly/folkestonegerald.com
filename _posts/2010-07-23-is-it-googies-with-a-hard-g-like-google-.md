Or Googies with a soft G like... um Goujons? I can't actually think of a word that has a soft G in the middle like that. OK like in Sage. Which one is it? Seems obvious to me that it's pronounced "Googies" but my wife keeps saying "Googies". Is she talking gibberish or what?

UPDATE: Having spoken to Googy himself, it's Googies with two hard Gs like Google.
