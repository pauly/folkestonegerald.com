Friday 16th December, isn't everyone normally at some Pogues reunion show in London around this time though? Blimey though, proper contemporary pop, LCH you are spoiling us! 

Get the album <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009OU2M8">Stars of CCTV</a>, and we can all sing along together!
