I have visited Timothy's Wine Bar twice now on my journeys through Folkestone and now will make a point of ensuring I go in each time. I agree with Lisa, I think you were just incredibly unlucky with your evening. I find the staff more than friendly and the food excellent. Having a  vegan in the family, I do understand the problems and pitfalls of restaurants but found that Tim and the chefs couldn't do enough to look after us. I love the atmosphere and cant wait to become a recognisable customer, hearing my name shouted as I walk through the door, and having a nice glass of red handed to me as I'm ushered to my favourite table. Id give it another chance if I were you.
