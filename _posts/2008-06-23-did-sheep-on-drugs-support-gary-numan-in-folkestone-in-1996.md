I've heard this mentioned before, it's making sense now, from <a href="http://ilovekiefer.blogspot.com/2008/03/another-longish-catch-up.html">this blog</a>:

<blockquote>they made all previous supports seem like geniuses in comparison (and I include <a href="/wiki/sheep+on+drugs">Sheep on Drugs</a> at Folkestone Pavilion in [year]1996[/year])</blockquote>

So something happened that night to get them kicked off the <a href="/wiki/gary+numan">Gary Numan</a> tour. So that places them and he in Folkestone, at the Pavilion, in March [year]1996[/year], quite possibly with the lead piping!

Doesn't sound very likely that a major tour would be at the Pavilion though, I think it's the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a> again, and <a href="http://discography.garynuman.info" title="Gary Numan gigography">this gigography</a> says so too (although it says <a href="/wiki/leas+cliffe+hall">Leas Cliffe Hall</a>).
