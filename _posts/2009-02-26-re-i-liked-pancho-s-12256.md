Ahhh... The Scottish couple were I believe Mother and Son (lived in Dymchurch I think...) and took over from Jerry and Melvin. They kept it going quiet well for a while but it did slowly lose business and then packed up altogether. Such a shame, I really loved the atmosphere there, the food was good, the cocktails also and they did play plenty of Gipsy Kings...  ;-)
