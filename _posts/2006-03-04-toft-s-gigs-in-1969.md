Concerning TOFT`S I would like to give you the following information:
In 1969 the address was "35 to 39, Grace Hill"

<blockquote>A great honour for the club was the gig of
<a href="/wiki/eric+clapton">Eric Clapton</a>   with Derek and <a href="/wiki/dominoes">The Dominoes</a>
on Saturday 15th August 1969
(Strictly limited number of Tickets 15/-)</blockquote>

Greetings from Hannover and
keep on rocking
