From <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/blog/87/96//Nice-long-weekend-in-Sandgate-Folkeston.html" title="Detailing our trip to Truffles and a few other things">my recent blog posting</a>: <blockquote>Friday night we had our proper birthday night out, taken out for a meal by Clare's bro and fiance to Truffles. I was a bit apprehensive, as we'd checked out the menu when it first opened (it used to be Panchos and La Bamba) and there was nothing for me, and I'm not usually the type to say "just make me something". Someone else was booking, so they did, and it was FANTASTIC. Shame to not see it busier in there, I don't understand it not being packed to the rafters, I heartily recommend it.</blockquote>
As I say, I wasn't sure about this place beforehand, seeing nothing on the menu at first glance I discounted it. However, the menu has changed since we first looked, and there were a few options to tempt me - throw into the mix the guarantee they'd sort something out for me and I was ready to go.

I'll run through my meal first, as this was the top priority for me, but everyone elses (non vegan) meal looked great too.

My starter was leak and potato soup, though it tasted far more exciting than that might sound. There was an exciting extra taste in the soup, something a bit lively, which gave me the fear that it might be BACON or something, but I am assured everything was good for me to eat. Presentation was excellent. Other starters included scallops in prosciutto, and pigeon breasts in something or other.

My main was butternut squash and othe vegetables in some fabulous flavourings or other - I think it was a bit curried - all wrapped in a "pancake" (more like a tortilla). Pud would have been just fruit, but I went for a glass of Sauterne instead, should have had it with something really.

Price; who knows. We had nearly a bottle of wine each and it came to about thirty-five pounds a head I think, but it was a birthday present so I didn't get too close to the bill.

Heartily recommended!
