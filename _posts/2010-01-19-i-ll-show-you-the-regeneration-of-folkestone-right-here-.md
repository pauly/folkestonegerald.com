Never mind your <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter">creative quarter</a> and your <a href="/wiki/asda">ASDA</a> and all that, look whose front door was open today! This is evidence of the regeneration of <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>.

I don't remember seeing it in the masterplan, but I think that's all out the window now. So who is working on <a href="/wiki/+the+elizabethan+and+what+are+they+doing+flats+offices+or+an+actual+new+place+to+go+in+folkestone">]]The Elizabethan, and what are they doing? Flats? Offices? Or an actual new place to go in [[Folkestone</a>?

I say "legendary" Folkestone venue, maybe it's just me who is obsessed with it. I have lived here for about six years and never seen it open, what a treat to have a peek inside.

I did not dare actually go in, but if you ever did (<a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/m/8321/Someone%27s+been+inside%21">this person did</a> does that still look about the same? Reminds me of a <a href="/wiki/beefeater">Beefeater</a> or something.

I'm off to <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=legends+of+folkestone">Legends of Folkestone</a> with this one.
