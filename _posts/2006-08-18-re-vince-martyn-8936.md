Hiya, Vince Martyn here, nice to know someone likes the band. We're playing at the Clarenden Hotel Deal on Sunday night 20th August. Got Tom Arnold on Hammond, Rufus Ruffell on Guitar, Gordon (thudmaster) May on Bass, Me singing and strummin' and Alesis SR16 on drums. Mel Duffy might make an appearance on pedal steel if things work out. Niiiice!!  seeyalater. xVx
