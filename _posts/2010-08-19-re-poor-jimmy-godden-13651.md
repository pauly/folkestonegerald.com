With his (alleged) ill gotten gains gained through fiery speculation on the Kent coast he bought a celebrated Robert Adam mansion near Ashford after its owner Baron, Lord Brabourne chucked an incumbent leasing childrens home out of it. The illustrious lord refused a further lease to the childrens home when it came up for renewal. The noble lord, presumably, wanted to make extra dosh pronto with its fabulous sale. Jimmy Godden snapped the aristocratic pile up for a cool 3million+. The childrens home was forced to up-sticks c.2002. They trundled into a woebegone annex nearby where they thrive, unfortunately, without the grand inspiring surroundings of a Capability Brown that they used to enjoy. Nevertheless, one understands they are reasonably enthused with a more modern, ethical disparate housing structure designed, not unlike an old peoples home for the young.
