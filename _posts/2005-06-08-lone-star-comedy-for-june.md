Hope everyone is well and enjoying the good weather.  I have details for the next <a href="http://www.lonestarcomedy.co.uk">Lone Star Comedy Club</a> - there may, or may not, be material about yoghurt so be sure to bring earplugs if you find such dairy based products offensive.
 
On the next club night we welcome to the Lone Star stage:
 
<a href="/wiki/robin+ince">ROBIN INCE</a> (Robin is a comedian, writer, presenter, all round popular culture pundit and film expert, boasting one of the most impressive CV's on the comedy circuit.  As well as an amusingly brief appearance in BBC2's "The Office", Robin has also worked on E4's "The Pilot Show" and Channel 4's "The 11 O'Clock Show".  If you went to see <a href="/wiki/ricky+gervais">Ricky Gervais</a> on his last tour, you would've seen Robin opening as Ricky specifically chose him as support for his entire tour.  He is a genuinely fantastic comedian, and one of my personal favourites on the whole circuit - a real treat)
 
<a href="/wiki/rhod+gilbert">RHOD GILBERT</a> (In all fairness, Rhod would probably be equally at home as a headline act at the club as he is now much in demand as a top act in some of the nation's top clubs including The Comedy Store and Jongleurs, where he regularly headlines shows.  He started stand-up in 2002, and now performs regularly in the UK and around the world.  This summer at the Edinburgh Festival he will deliver his first full-length solo show entitled "Rhod Gilbert's 1984".)
 
<a href="/wiki/lloyd+langford">LLOYD LANGFORD</a> (Some of you may remember young Lloyd from his storming 10-minute open spot last July.  He's asked to come back and play again, and additionally he was requested onto the bill by Rhod Gilbert, so we're more than happy to have him back.  For those who didn't see him, Lloyd won the Chortle Student Comic Awards in 2004 and is a real star for the future.)
 
guest compere WINDSOR (<a href="/wiki/danny">Danny</a> is taking a month off, but we're pleased to welcome Windsor in his place.  Windsor is a first class compere and stand-up who has combined years of street-performance skills with a natural charm and warmth, along with an enviable ability to make people relax.  He'll be great.)
 
all this at <a href="/wiki/lanterns">THE LANTERNS</a> on <a href="/wiki/rendezvous+street">RENDEZVOUS STREET</a> in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">FOLKESTONE</a> on SATURDAY JUNE 18TH
Tickets are available now and are 8 full price or 6 concessions - please phone Richard on 07810864228 to reserve your tickets and tables for large groups now!
 
We have one more show in July featuring the truly unique <a href="/wiki/chris+lynam">CHRIS LYNAM</a>, before taking a break for the summer.  I have just had a peek at our line-ups for the Autumn though and there are some real treats in store. 
 
Hope to see as many of you as possible in June!

Tom @ Lone Star
