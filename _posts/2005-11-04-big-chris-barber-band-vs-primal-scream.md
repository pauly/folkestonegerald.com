Folkestone was discussed in the office today (in that London), <a href="/wiki/chris+barber+band">Chris Barber Band</a> are Very Good as jazz goes apparently... But! Is this being bumped off by <a href="/wiki/primal+scream">Primal Scream</a>? That's what I've heard today. This is probably a good thing for Folkestone, Primal Scream are not what they once were, but it's still high profile and contemporary! <a href="http://www.wayahead.com/livegigpopex/price.asp?code=167782&userid=277192625&filler1=livegigpopex">tickets are on sale here</a>, seems Folkestone is the ONLY date. What's that all about? Ah well see you there...
