Searching for Folkestone news I found <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006150728,00.html">this story about a guy who got drunk and woke up in Africa</a>, a bit sensationalised, it was Tunisia rather than the wilds somewhere, but it looks like he might have been from Folkestone. Anyway, point is, that's not a very nice caption underneath his picture...
