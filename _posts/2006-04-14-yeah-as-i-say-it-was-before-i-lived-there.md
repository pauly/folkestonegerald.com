Oh no, I sounded like one of those "Folkestone Arts" types... I loved Fresh and Wild, most people do, but I'm just saying that some people (the early adopter bohemian meeja types who lived in Stokey in the early '90s) see all chains as bad, but then again some people who say they see all chains as bad would love something like <a href="/wiki/fresh+and+wild">Fresh and Wild</a>, that other people objected to strongly. I don't want to live in a village right now, the independent hand made toys and rubbish boutiques of <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/cgi-bin/board.cgi/stoke+newington+church+street">Stoke Newington Church Street</a> really got on my tits, but the restaurants and pubs there were fantastic. I would choose <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/cgi-bin/board.cgi/Il+Bacio">Il Bacio</a> over a <a href="/wiki/pizza+express">Pizza Express</a>, and think that <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/cgi-bin/board.cgi/The+Defoe">The Defoe</a> was a better pub than <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a>. Hmm I've  lost my train of thought now and can't remember why I moved here again...

Anyway, la la la not listening to you, Folkestone is Highgate-on-Sea, the West End is mostly like Primrose Hill I think...

Losing M&S (another chain) is bad, it is also just WEIRD, when it seems other big stores are lining up to move in. It could be just the big gap between now and the new shopping centre being open, maybe M&S will come back then?

To sum up, some chains are GOOD for a town, most are very good for a town that's been in the doldrums like this one for so long, <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks </a>will be good for this town.
