<a href="/wiki/ben+spalding">Ben Spalding</a> is <a href="http://kent.gumtree.com/kent/36/67234436.html">advertising on Gumtree</a> for a "chef de partie"

<blockquote>chef de partie needed for a new opening in february in fokestone, dover
preferred to have rosette or michelin experience, but more importantly MUST have a great attitude and be prepared to work very hard and long hours with michelin trained chef (ex ramsay, ex thomas keller).
This is a brilliant chance to be part of something special, would suit recent college leave or extremely passionate cook prepared to GIVE THEIR ALL. Contact ben by email to talk more if interested..No timewasters</blockquote>

Bringing some Michelin star skills to Folkestone sounds nice. I hope the cooking is better than the geography, and the website goes nowhere. Will keep an eye on this one...
