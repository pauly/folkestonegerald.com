Battle of the Bands at Lantern's, 5th may 2010
There is a lack of Hip Hop / Rap in Folkestone. In 2006-2008 you couldn't walk around the town without seeing fliers promoting AMS (Altered Mind States) Mumble Arts or The Kulpritz. Now, it's as if there's only 2 people who are willing to promote local Hip Hop for no profit, Louie and Di Burns. There were 2 hip hop groups in Heat 2, AMS and Mumble Arts and another rap group in Heat 3 last night, SECTION 19. Hopefully more hip hop/d+b/grime artists will make themselves known soon.
Thankyou Louie and Di for last night and for promoting the local artists, thanks to the doormen, and to Emma for introducing, HUGE thanks to the Sound Engineers (it won't be .wav's next time...), and thanks to everyone who performed, attended and supported last night PEACE
SECTION 19 XIX
