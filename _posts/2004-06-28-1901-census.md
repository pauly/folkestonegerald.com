Checking the <a href="http://www.1901census.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">National Archives site</a> I can find no mention of <a href="/wiki/earls+avenue">Earls Avenue</a> from 1901 and it seems <a href="/wiki/bouverie+road+west">Bouverie Road West</a> only went up to number 15 at this time, I'd have thought both these roads were much older than this...
