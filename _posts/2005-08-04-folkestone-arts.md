There's a new mag in town it seems, someone saved me a copy of July's <a href="/wiki/folkestone+arts">Folkestone Arts</a>, put together by <a href="/wiki/nicholas+reed">Nicholas Reed</a> who had some involvement with <a href="/wiki/quarter">The Quarter</a>. It's only 8 pages of A5 (like me own dearly departed <a href="/wiki/sold+out">SOLD OUT</a>. It's a bit dry, not a lot of content, but it has managed to pull in some ads already. Well done you.
