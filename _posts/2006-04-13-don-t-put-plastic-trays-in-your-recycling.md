Boring but important <a href="http://www.shepway.gov.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1023&Itemid=449">message from the council</a>. We don't want any more excuses for the recycling not to work!

<blockquote>Shepway Council is renewing its message to people across the district to help its recycling efforts by only putting out items listed on the black box or blue bag.

The black boxes are for glass, tins and cans, and plastic bottles only. The blue bag is for paper and cardboard... some people are putting out items that cannot be collected and recycled  including plastic trays and packaging, cardboard drink cartons and broken glass.</blockquote>
