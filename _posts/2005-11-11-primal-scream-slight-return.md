I was just about to <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/17003B64A7366CF4?camefrom=CFC_UKAFF_POPE_POPEX">buy some Primal Scream tickets here</a>, but I think Ticketmaster are having a laugh with their delivery options. Not only is there a 3 pound per ticket booking fee, they want a fiver for postage (fair enough, it's special delivery) OR TWO POUND FIFTY IF I COLLECT THE TICKETS IN PERSON!

I'm not even that bothered about the band, but feel I ought to go, as it feels like a bit of a treat for Folkestone. The gig being on I mean, not me considering going. If I have time this weekend I'll walk down to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2/Leas%20Cliff%20Hall">the venue</a> in person and buy some.

I guess it's not too much of a rip, if the LCH isn't close to you, it's only 8.50 on top of the ticket price. Hmm...
