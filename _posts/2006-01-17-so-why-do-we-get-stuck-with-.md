<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/17003C30D316EAD8?camefrom=CFC_UKAFF_POPE_POPEX">Kevin Bloody Wilson</a>, when Portsmouth Guildhall gets <a href="/wiki/morrissey">Morrissey</a>? Bah...

Very much enjoying our <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009YVC7W/">Mighty Boosh DVD</a>, and looking forward to the show! I've given them their own special graphic and smoothed some of the corners on the calendar, see it all on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">the homepage</a>.
