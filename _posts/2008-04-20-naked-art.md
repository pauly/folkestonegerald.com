<a href="http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/nakedartstudio/">Naked Art Studio</a> are still selling their original art from the good town of Folkestone... <a href="http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/nakedartstudio/">check them out</a>.

<blockquote>I create very affordable, modern & abstract works of original art and paint using a rich blend of colours, textures and metallics (hand-mixed because the 'off the shelf' metallics are too predictable!) I absolutely love the light-reflecting qualities of the metallic paints - constantly changing in different light sources.</blockquote>
