Maybe we will give it another go...

The chutney experience is not a nice one, happened to me the other day at our last curry in <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/stokey/">Stoke Newington</a> (we have now moved to Folkestone full time) - everyone knows they must recycle them, but at least do it behind our backs!
