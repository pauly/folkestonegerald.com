Not a review, but something I've done before... we're off to Earl Brownes in Hythe for a post wedding feast next month, and as we're such a huge crowd they've asked us to pick in advance from a set menu. So, here is that set menu, to give you an impression of the kind of food they do there... Just copy-and-pasting this has made me hungry.

<blockquote><b>Starters</b>
King Prawn & langoustine potato Salad 
Parma Ham, Fig & mozzarella salad 
Chilli Tomato & Basil Filed Mushroom 
Stuffed & Rolled Courgette Rolls
Stuffed Grilled pesto Sardines

<b>Main</b>
Creamy Parsley, Apple & Pork 
Pan Roasted Rack of Lamb Filled With Parma Ham & Herbs 
Parmesan & Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken 
Fillet of Beef 
Pan Roasted Mediterranean vegetable Pasta 
Spicy Chicken Salad 


<b>Desserts</b>
Cheese Cake 
Cheese & Biscuits  
Ice Cream Fruit Sundae 

<b>Coffee & Mints</b></blockquote>
