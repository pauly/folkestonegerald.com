This from <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>:
<blockquote>Can't find anything about a support band anywhere, but apparently DJ <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alexander+milas">Alexander Milas</a> from <a href="/wiki/metal+hammer">Metal Hammer</a> was the support for the <a href="/wiki/birmingham">Birmingham</a> gig, and is also the support for the <a href="/wiki/oxford">Oxford</a> gig.... </blockquote>
