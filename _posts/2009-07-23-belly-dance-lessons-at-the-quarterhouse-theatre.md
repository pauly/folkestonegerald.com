I run a company called 'Metamorphosis Belly Dance' ([url]www.metabellydance.co.uk[/url]) which provides hour workshops to teach Belly Dance at parties in Kent.

I am considering doing weekly Belly Dance lessons at The Quarterhouse Theatre in Folkestone. It would last for an hour and cost about 7. I am unsure if it is worth it so if you would be interested then just let me know at metabellydance@googlemail.com

Thank you and hope to hear from you
