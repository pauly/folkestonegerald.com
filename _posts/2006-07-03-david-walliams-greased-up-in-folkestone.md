<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=david+walliams">David Walliams</a> is swimming The Channel tomorrow, from Folkestone beach. Good charity fund raising work funnyman feller! <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006300472,00.html">The Sun has more</a>...

If anyone has any episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_%28television%29">the Comedy Central TV show "Asylum"</a> (I think it featured <a href="/wiki/david+walliams">David Walliams</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/simon+pegg">Simon Pegg</a>, <a href="/wiki/jessica+stevenson">Jessica Stevenson</a>, <a href="/wiki/julian+barratt">Julian Barratt</a> and other comedy greats) on video or DVD or a [google=asylum torrent]torrent[/google], please get in touch, I'd love to see them again.
