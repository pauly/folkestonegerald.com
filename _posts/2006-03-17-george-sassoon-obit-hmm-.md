George Sassoon, who has died aged 69, was the son, and only child, of the poet Siegfried Sassoon, and attained distinction in a number of interesting fields, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/17/db1701.xml&sSheet=/portal/2006/03/17/ixportal.html">read all about him in the Telegraph</a>. He's mentioned here for a comment he once made about our locale:
<blockquote>He was also a keen student of international affairs, advocating a solution to the problem of Gibraltar that involved offering Spain a reciprocal enclave in southern England - perhaps <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/Dover" title="Check out bars and restaurants and that in Dover">Dover</a> or <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com" title="back to the homepage, it's all about Folkestone...">Folkestone</a> - which would become a centre for bullfighting and other facets of Spanish life.</blockquote>
