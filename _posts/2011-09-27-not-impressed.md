Unable to get 2 showers on the first morning.  Went to discuss this and were told that WE had left the tap running, which we CERTAINLY had NOT.  Very rude to my wife and although apologised for his rudeness to me still said WE had left the tap on.  This has apparently happened on a number of occasions.  Were the taps in poor condition?  No they shut off fine. This again happened on the following morning after obviously ensuring all taps were turned off.  The continental breakfast is a joke.  It consisted of items left in a fridge in your room and only the tea/coffee making facilities as your drink i.e. 2 each per day. There was decaf, which my wife drinks, available on the 1st day but when topped up was not replenished with decaf.  No table to sit at for breakfast and very limited choice.  If you don't like porridge you go hungry.  The mattress needs replacing as we found ourselves permanently in the middle.  The room was cold and the heating non eventful.  Right next to the bin store where all the bottles were emptied too early and too noisily so disturbing us.  There was no information at all in the room for the area or the facilities and most important of all what to do in an Emergency/Fire we would not have known where to assemble.  The towels were old, thin, small and rough.  the shower screen hardly stopped the water and so flooded the bathroom floor, which had been happening for a long period of time as evidenced by the damage seen.  Overall the worst place we have ever stayed in, in over 20 years of travelling around the world.
