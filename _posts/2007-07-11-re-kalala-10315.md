A group of us from the Dymchurch Players went to Kalala Restaurant last week, 17 of us. We thoroughly enjoyed the food it was excellent.
My only complaint, personally, was that I couldn't have eaten more than I did, it was so nice - but - well, my husband and I are not big eaters so obviously we'll have to keep going back again to enjoy it in smaller portions.
(pity they don't do a senior citizens price - as we don't eat such big meals as the youngsters.
Never mind - we will go whenever we can afford it.
