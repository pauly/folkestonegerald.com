Not the actual <a href="/wiki/creative+quarter">creative quarter</a>, just <a href="http://www.thequarter.org.uk">the free magazine</a>, according to a story in this week's <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a>. The July issue will be the last one. No idea if they will keep <a href="http://www.thequarter.org.uk">the website</a> going, or just let it gently expire.

So, if you have a gig or event to promote, you know where to come now! Maybe I should start sending out a newsletter, to fill this gap. Recently found my old fanzines again, but not sure I have the time or energy to be printing stuff out and distributing it, we'll see...

Weekend plans? We're going to <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> for the first time in AGES.
