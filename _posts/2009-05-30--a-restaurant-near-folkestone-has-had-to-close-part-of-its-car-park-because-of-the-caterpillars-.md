<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/05/30/the-invasion-of-the-hairy-caterpillars-115875-21400210/">Says here in the Mirror</a>, but what restaurant? I was thinking, the only restaurant I know in Folkestone that's high falutin' enough to have its own car park is <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/57/Paul's">Paul's</a> isn't it? But this does say near <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>, not in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>... so where then, anyone know? I expect it was in the local paper...
