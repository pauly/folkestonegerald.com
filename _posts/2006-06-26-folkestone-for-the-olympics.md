Not the Olympics for Folkestone, obviously, but I've seen a few news reports from across the seas, sees <a href="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Olympics/News/2006/06/24/1651219-ap.html">Canadian</a> and <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/worldsports/story/9524357">American sports fans</a> are being told that Folkestone's a good place to stay if visiting the Olympics in 2012! These are all from the same newswire story, but still, start clearing out that spare room now, there's money to be made!
