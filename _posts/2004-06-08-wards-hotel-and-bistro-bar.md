Got round to visiting <a href="/wiki/wards">Wards</a> at last, it's our local, though we thought it'd be crap... pleasantly surprised, not bad at all for a hotel bar. No real ales, but didn't expect any, but they do have Amstel and John Smiths... They do food, but we didn't try any, very simple pub type fair I think.

The crowd was a mix of local people and residents, and the atmosphere wasn't unfriendly. Only problem ws the music, dire pan pipes bollocks, and it was a bit bright.
