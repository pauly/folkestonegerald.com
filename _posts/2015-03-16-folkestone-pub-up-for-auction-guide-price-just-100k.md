It's the <a href="/wiki/princess+royal">Princess Royal</a>, last seen in the excellent TV <a href="/wiki/crime+drama">crime drama</a> <a href="/wiki/tunnel">The Tunnel</a>. Been neglected for a while (though price of <a href="http://www.dover-express.co.uk/Opportunities-harbour-pub-auction/story-26152906-detail/story.html">I'm sure we drunk in there about 5 years ago) so a guide just 100k</a>! Bargain, seems like a great spot for when the area picks up.

Hope we see this on eon <a href="/wiki/homes+under+the+hammer">Homes Under The Hammer</a>, but as it's a commercial possibly not.
