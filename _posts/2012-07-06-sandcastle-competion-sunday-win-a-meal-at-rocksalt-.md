Unfortunately this just missed the mailout...

<blockquote>I don't suppose you could add the details of the Folkestone Sandcastle Competition this Sunday? I should have contacted you already, I'm really sorry. Details attached.

Prizes include a meal for two at Rocksalt and a return trip for car and passengers to Calais from P&O Ferries...

More details I'm sure at <a href="http://www.shanerecord.com">shanerecord.com</a> - I will try and post more when I am less busy.
