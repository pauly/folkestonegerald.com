On 28th and 29th October, Sainsbury's Folkestone town centre store is holding a Haunted Halloween weekend for their Local Charity of the Year Headway East Kent. The store will be transformed into a spectacular spooky supermarket with staff joining in the fun and paying 1 to dress up in their scariest outfits. There will be fun and games for everyone with all the proceeds going to Headway East Kent. Activities on offer will include freaky face painting, bobbing for apples, crazy colouring and trick or treat. You will be transported into a world of spooky characters and freaky events which are fun for all the family!
