<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.assuragroup.co.uk/folkestone%20metronome%20cinema.aspx">assura group has a metronome page</a>, looks like they own other medical type facilities so this backs up the story of it being bought by a health care trust.

Just found a <a href="/wiki/pj+harvey">PJ Harvey</a> gig at the <a href="/wiki/metronome">Metronome</a>, and another where she almost played at <a href="/wiki/bottoms">Bottoms</a>. But it was cancelled.

Still looking for more <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/history/">Folkestone gig histor</a>, if you can contribute any [reply]please do[/reply]...
