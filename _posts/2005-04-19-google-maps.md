Just updated all the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/cgi-bin/venue">venue pages</a> to include a google map now. I was using <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk">streetmap.co.uk</a>, but have been excited about <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Google Maps</a> for a while and am pleased to see they have expanded to the UK...

Here's a <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ct20">map of Folkestone</a>.
