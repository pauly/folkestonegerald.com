You could easily spend 250k round here, but if you were thinking of a nice sea view that's more the price of a (quite fancy) 2 bedroom flat on the sea front.

Apparently 3 or 4 years ago you could get a big old house near the station for that sort of money, but they're more like 450k.

As Mick says, best come down and have a look.
