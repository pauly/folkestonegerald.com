Just a quick reviewette of our experience in Pizza Express, Canterbury, this Saturday. Our meal was a bit rubbish!

It was busy, it was a Saturday lunchtime and it is Canterbury, but we waited for nearly an hour to be served, and then the pizza wasn't up to normal Pizza Express standards, what a shame!
