Having a Starbucks is not a good thing, what will happen to all those little cafes on our street corners, particularly the fabulous Chambers?  Starbucks will not provide healthy competition as some people might think,they are a multinational company only in it for the money.
My money will still be spent in quirky little street cafes, I for one will not be tempted by Starbucks!
