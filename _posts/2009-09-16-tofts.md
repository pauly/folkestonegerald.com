I remember the good old days of Tofts. I used to walk up the stairs, past John Brunt who was the bouncer, to see Doris and Harold Toft, her standing behind the drinks bar and him standing in front welcoming people into the club. Lovely to read that Harold is still alive. Remembering him with fond memories.
