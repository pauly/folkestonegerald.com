Who on earth has a site called <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.injurywatch.co.uk/news-and-groups/news/accidents-at-events/boy-injured-in-fall-as-cable-snaps-at-folkestone-adventure-park-23116648">injury watch</a>..?
<blockquote>An investigation is under way after a cable slide at a children's adventure playground snapped, sending an 11-year-old boy falling to the ground.

The accident happened on Tuesday afternoon at the Lower Leas Coastal Park Fun Zone, in Folkestone, Kent. The youngster was taken to hospital with injuries to his face.

Police said it appeared the zip line's metal cable snapped. Shepway Council, which runs the park, said the Health and Safety Executive had been informed.

A council spokeswoman said: "We had our health and safety officer and the park manager down there after the accident, and we will be speaking to the equipment manufacturers." </blockquote>
