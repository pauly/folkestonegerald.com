<blockquote>A PERVERT is dressing up like movie character Mrs Doubtfire to grope teenage girls.

The cunning predator disguises himself as a granny to strike up conversation with teenagers and young women.

Police warned: "He comes across as harmless and usually says he is cold and asks for a cuddle.

"He then touches them in a sexual way. We believe he may have filmed his victims.

"When he is dressed up he looks just like Mrs Doubtfire and wears a coat or shawl."

His disguise is so convincing police said it was hard to spot he was a man. He has struck most often in Folkestone and Canterbury areas of Kent.

In the 1993 movie, Robin Williams disguises himself as a Scottish nanny to get hired by his ex-wife and be closer to his family. </blockquote>

I'm off to look for you today Doubtfire, so look out!
