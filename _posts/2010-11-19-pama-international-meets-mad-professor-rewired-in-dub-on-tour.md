PAMA INTERNATIONAL on tour - An unrivaled sonic assault of dub - transcending the generations.

From their inception in 2001 Pama Intl have been brewing a unique blend of 60's soul, 70's reggae with a 21st century commentary. As much King Tubby as the southern soul sounds of Stax, all the time remaining distinctly Pama Intl. In 2006 they became the first new band to sign to the legendary Trojan Records in 30 years. The revolving nature of the collective's line up has seen the band line up members from The Specials, Madness, Steel Pulse, Galliano, The Lee Perry Band, Pop Will Eat Itself, Steel Pulse, Style Council, Bentley Rhythm Ace, The Selecter and collaborations with Dennis Alcapone, Dave & Ansel Collins, Billy Bragg, Groove Corp, Mungos Hi Fi, Michie One, Rico Rodriguez, Derrick Morgan and Dawn Penn.
