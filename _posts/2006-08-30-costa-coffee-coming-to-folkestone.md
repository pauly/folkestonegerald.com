<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=costa+coffee">Costa Coffee</a> are moving into Sandgate Road, in the old QS premises. the store opens in September, and they're currently advertising for employees.

So, does this mean <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> still is, or they never were, or what? Did the Costa factoid confuse the news (and rumour) mongers?

Here is a picture of QS, so you can remember it as it was (just after it shut down). If you squint you can possibly make out the phone number to call for job opportunities. Do they need a web developer do you think..?

OH YEAH, the <a href="/wiki/british+heart+foundation">British Heart Foundation</a> <a href="/wiki/charity+shop">charity shop</a> in nearby <a href="/wiki/guildhall+street">Guildhall Street</a> is also closing, this is a good sign, <a href="/wiki/guildhall+street">Guildhall Street</a> is right on the up I feel.
