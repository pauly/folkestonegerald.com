<a href="/wiki/guitar+lessons">Guitar lessons</a>, <a href="/wiki/tai+chi">Tai Chi</a>, art workshops and a book club are on offer all over the summer, sounds great!
<blockquote>The Mind, Body and Soul evenings were the brainchild of the Mermaid's owners <a href="/wiki/clare+townley">Clare Townley</a> and <a href="/wiki/sarah+reed">Sarah Reed</a>, who got in touch with local artist <a href="/wiki/deborah+crofts">Deborah Crofts</a>. Deborah then invited other tutors to join her in leading six weeks of activities at the Mermaids spectacular location beside the sea.

Says Deborah: "This is a chance to explore your creativity, learn new skills, meet friends, join informal discussions with like-minded people, enjoy light exercise and meditate within the beautiful surroundings of the beach, Coastal Park and the welcoming environment of the Mermaids Caf Bar."

Beginning on Monday 28 July and running until 11 September, the sessions cover a different theme each evening:

[*] Mondays (28th July to 1st September) learn to play the guitar, covering the basics of chord and melody; including styles to suit all tastes from Hendrix to Jeff Buckley and Oasis. Run by musician <a href="/wiki/james+rowdon">James Rowdon</a>.
[*] Tuesdays (5th August to 9th September) read new authors and enjoy discussion in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Make sure you bring your own book suggestions to the Mermaids Book Club. Run by performing artist and songwriter Amanda Beckett.
[*] Wednesdays (6th August to 10th September), dip your hand into creativity and experience painting and drawing, whatever your level, in the fantastic surroundings of Folkestones Coastal Park and beach. Workshops run by artist Deborah Crofts.
[*] Thursdays (7th August to 11th September) learn to relax deeply, improve balance and re-align your body with Tai Chi. Exercises will help to release stress, enhance energy and improve breathing. Run by Tai Chi tutor <a href="/wiki/dave+willis">Dave Willis</a>.
