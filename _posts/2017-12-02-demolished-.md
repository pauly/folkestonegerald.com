That was a surprise, to see the pub finally demolished after being left in that state for so long. Guessing it's not going to be another pub built on that site. Wish I'd got some pictures of it before it went now, not that it was a pub I had ever been in. I took some pictures of the <a href="/wiki/fountain">Fountain</a> the other day, as it's closed, but seems as if it will reopen.
