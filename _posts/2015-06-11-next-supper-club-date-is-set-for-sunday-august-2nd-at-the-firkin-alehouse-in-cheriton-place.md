The next <a href="http://acrusteaten.com/supperclub/">supper club</a> is announced, from <a href="http://acrusteaten.com">A Crust Eaten</a>:

<blockquote>We're hoping to do a grilling menu with a Spanish twist and - hopefully - take advantage of some beautiful summer weather! The menu is going to be something along these lines:

MENU

Grilled spring onions with romesco sauce



White gazpacho with pickled shrimp



Grilled fish, chorizo and mussels with olive oil croutons and saffron aioli



Grilled peaches with vanilla cream and almond crumble

It's 25pp and there will be <a href="/wiki/real+ale">real ale</a>, <a href="/wiki/cider">cider</a>, <a href="/wiki/wine">wine</a> and soft drinks to purchase on the night. Sangria is also in negotiation. :)

Get in touch as soon as you can if you'd like tickets because spaces are really limited at The Firkin and there are two spaces gone already</blockquote>

Not so <a href="/wiki/vegan">vegan</a> this time so I won't be there, but heartily recommended. I'd love to go to one at the <a href="/wiki/firkin">Firkin</a>.
