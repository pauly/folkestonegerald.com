It looks like <a href="/wiki/ship">The Ship</a> and the bike shop next door (currently <a href="/wiki/loaf">Loaf</a> cafe) always had a connection, it's the same building, and you used to be able to pass from one to the other. There are more details in the fabulous <a href="/wiki/tales+from+the+tap+room">Tales From The Tap Room</a>, [ebay=Tales From The Tap Room]ebay it, I have a copy and it's great[/ebay]. Now that connection is being opened up again, it looks like <a href="/wiki/ship">The Ship</a> is expanding back into the next door premises. Will it be a new bar? Part of the <a href="/wiki/restaurant">restaurant</a>? Who knows? No-one is telling me, but everyone seems to know about it.
