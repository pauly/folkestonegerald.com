And <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/5271784.stm">this is why Operation Stack came into play</a>

<blockquote>The operator Eurotunnel said it suspended rail services on Monday afternoon when a fire alarm went off.

Lorry drivers were taken off the train in the north-running tunnel. A fire was put out about 7.5 miles (12km) from Folkestone. No-one was hurt. </blockquote>
