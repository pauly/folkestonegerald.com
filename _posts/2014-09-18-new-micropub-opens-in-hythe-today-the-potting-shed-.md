Being opened by the <a href="http://hopfuzz.co.uk">hopfuzz.co.uk</a> people, sounds great. Opening today at 6.30, but I'm at <a href="/wiki/swimming">swimming</a> with <a href="/wiki/harry">Harry</a> then. Maybe I can drop him in the pool, leg it there for one, and be back to pick him up..?

Also this weekend <a href="/wiki/folkestone+beer+festival">Folkestone Beer Festival</a>, and I'm mostly going to miss that. It's all go round here!

UPDATE: think I was wrong about the <a href="/wiki/hop+fuzz">Hop Fuzz</a> connection...
