The Three Mackerel is now for sale for 85k - why why why? - that is just for the leasehold business, not the property! Don't prospective buyers actually  look at the books? 

Season and (Cllr) Tim were a lovely, media-savvy couple, but couldn't make it go of it. Then came the  Elvis-obsessed (wtf?) Nostalgia chap, followed by the forgettable tenant of the interestingly-named Euphoria. Literally dozens turned up on the opening night looking for Folkestone's latest gay venue, only to find a cheap re-hash of The Front, full of Folkestone yobs, most of whom had never met "a gay."

This brings us to The Three Mackerel. Just more of the same: doomed to fail. For God's sake, do us all a favour and turn this failure into apartments and DO NOT waste 85k on trying to take advantage of Godden and de Haan's pathetic future for the town. Neither the seafront, the "University," the new Asda-dominated shopping "centre," the sad creative  area, or the re-juvenation of Tontine  Street will ever make The Three Mackerel a success. Ask Cllr and Mrs Prater, and all the other broke tenants what they think.
