250k but I think that's a guide price for <a href="/wiki/auction">auction</a>. <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/commercial-property-for-sale/property-41171358.html">Here it is</a>.
<blockquote> Situated on Sandgates Esplanade with uninterrupted views of the sea and coastline, Bar Vasa is a well known restaurant/bar with function room and terrace. The property is located on the A259, between the centres of Folkestone and Hythe, with only the road separating the building from the beach.

As the restaurant is equipped it may be possible to resume trading. The premises may also have the potential to operate as a variety of commercial uses or convert into residential, subject to all necessary consents being obtainable. </blockquote>

I bet it gets turned into flats, though it's only the lower levels for sale there...
