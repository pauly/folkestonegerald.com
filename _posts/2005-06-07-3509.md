Hi, can tell you took the photo a while ago, ours is the floor with all the windowboxes and have now got hanging baskets. Flower display now flourishing. Nice flat, shame about the landlord and contractors. We were informed by them that this is a Grade 2 listed building, but have looked into that one and found that it isn't.

As you say, it is nice that they have kept the original frontage.
