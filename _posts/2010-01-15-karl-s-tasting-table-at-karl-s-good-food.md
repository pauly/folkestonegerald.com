<blockquote>Every Thursday or Friday, we will be sending an e-mail detailing the wines we will be sampling for the weekend. We will also be offering a 10% discount on purchases of these wines. To kick us off, feel free to pop in this weekend to try these:
Reds

    * Mendoza Bonarda, Colonia Las Liebres: Bonarda is normally used as an unremarkable blending variety in Italy but in this part of Argentina, it really comes into its own as a varietal. Lovely vibrant colour and lively damsony and other bramble fruit on the nose - 7.95
    * Merlot, Lyeth, Sonoma Country, California: Silky smooth Californian red with abundant flavours of plum, wild berry, currant and hints of mint and spices - 9.95 
    * Great Southern Cabernet Sauvignon, Plantagenet: Great finesse here with just the right amount of age behind it to make it perfect for drinking now. Silky mulberry fruit with hints of tobacco and cedar - 16.95
    * Margaret River Red, Cullen, Western Australia: Predominantly Malbec with a proportion of Merlot. Biodynamic viticulture is practised on all the Cullen vineyards in order to maximise the flavours in the grapes by improving and sustaining their unique environment. Bright ruby red in colour with vibrant perfumes of dark fruits, blackberries and plums. On the palate, plenty of juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit with touches of toasty oak and spice. Well balanced with rounded tannins and a long finish - 13.50

Whites

    * Secreto Viognier, Colchagua, Chile: Aged on its lees, this attractive Viognier displays lifted aromatic notes of ripe quince and pear followed in the mouth by layers of papaya and lemon-meringue pie over a bright, racy acidity imparting impressive structure and length - 11.50
    * Petit Chablis, Domaine Gerard Tremblay: Excellant example of good Chablis. Unoaked and delightfully fresh and crisp with a clean mineral edge - 12.50
    * Adelaide Hills Sauvignon Blanc, Shaw and Smith: Nice rounded Sauvignon Blanc from Shaw and Smith, one of Australias best producers of this variety. Beautifully balanced and displaying mouth-watering flavours of lemon and grapefruit in abundance - 12.50
