There's a half page story in <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">The Folkestone Herald</a> this week about how there's NOT going to be a strip club opening up under <a href="/wiki/la+vue">La Vue</a>... what a non story, brilliant publicity though, did anyone suspect their might be one? It's a great puff piece that advertises the room under the bar is available for private hire, the venue is going for a late license, and they're after a license that will allow "adults only" events...

These pics that appear below aren't connected to any kind of adult event, they should be a random strip of pics drunkenly taken when we were at La Vue for New Years Eve... No idea who most of them are even of, but I thought I'd brighten the place up a bit...
