We generally do the train, I think coaches might be tricky... train up to London Bridge (not the express, that will be more expensive) and then down to Folkestone, OR you can go via Redhill and Tonbridge - might be cheaper as you are avoiding London. There are not as many trains going that way, but it's not any slower.
