<blockquote>@FenlandGent Best thing I've found in that <a href="/wiki/nme">NME</a> back issue. - on the evening of [year=1984]24/5/84[/year] <a href="/wiki/black+flag">Black Flag</a> & <a href="/wiki/husker+du">HUSKER DU</a> played at "<a href="/wiki/peter+pipers">Peter Pipers</a>" in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a></blockquote>

I'm guessing it's a previous name for <a href="/wiki/pipers">Pipers</a> but anyone know for sure? I got in touch with @FenlandGent but they had no idea, they were just pleased to see a mention of their favourite bands playing a double bill like that in an old <a href="/wiki/nme">NME</a>.

Anyone out there gigging in the [year]1980[/year]s who might have been at this gig?

It's nice to have a bit more <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/history/">Folkestone gig history</a> anyway.
