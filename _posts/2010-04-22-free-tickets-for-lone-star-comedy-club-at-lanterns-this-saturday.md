Listen in to @adamdowling on <a href="/wiki/kmfm">KMFM</a> in the morning, I understand he will have free tickets to give away for the <a href="/wiki/comedy+club">comedy club</a> at <a href="/wiki/lanterns">Lanterns</a> this Saturday night (24th).

Hoping to get along to this one, Headliner is <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=james+dowdeswell">James Dowdeswell</a>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=james+dowdeswell">James Dowdeswell</a> is a real master of the comedian's craft. It is a genuine pleasure to be in the company of this master gag smith for an hour, an experience that few should really pass up.</blockquote>
