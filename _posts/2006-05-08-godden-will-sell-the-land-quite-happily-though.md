So no need for that, he wants full market rate for it though, and now it has planning permission that's a lot more than when it did not. Who would set the price for the compulsory purchase?

I see there is another compulsory purchase (or maybe even a confiscation) being considered of a derelict house in <a href="/wiki/augusta+gardens">Augusta Gardens</a>.
