We are new to Folkestone and a neighbour recommended La Tavernetta for our 10 year anniversay dinner. We are the type who manage to go out to dinner once a year as we have 2 small children and an even smaller budget for luxuries. I am the type who rarely manages to wear high heels and any makeup so last night was hopefully going to be really special for us.

I wish I had asked Folkestone Gerald for a recommended restaurant - all we ask for is soft lighting, a candle, a little ambience, hot food and some interesting blackboard specials. Our dinner was more like the dining room at Faulty Towers so we left immediately after main course. Plus babysitter fee we are sorry to say 50 could have bought a week of nice suppers at home, even if I would have to cook it is better than a dismal night on the town.

Please help Folkestone Gerald - where next year? Maybe we'll win a dinner voucher in our local area before then with luck!

There must be lots of great dining in Folkestone/Sandgate area - wish we knew what the local foodies know.

Many thanks, Jenn Peters
