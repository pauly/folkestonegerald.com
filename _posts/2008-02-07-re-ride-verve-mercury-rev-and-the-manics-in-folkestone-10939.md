I saw <a href="/wiki/ride">Ride</a> in Folkestone in [year]1992[/year], I believe at the Leas, used to have the ticket stub for date but cant help with that. 

I also attended the <a href="/wiki/manics">Manics</a> gig in folkestone at the venue that used to be the converted cinema. They had to reschedule the gig as James had a throat infection at last minute, leaving a tonne of <a href="/wiki/manics">Manics</a> fans wandering round Folkestone. The gig was hastily rearranged shortly afterwards but only about 60 people attended as it was short notice and badly advertised.......But was the <a href="/wiki/manics">Manics</a> at their best, did a fantastic gig despite the lack of numbers.
