Just got an update from <a href="http://www.ourproperty.co.uk">ourproperty.co.uk</a> to say they've updated the site or something. Did the usual check of my street and find that three neighbouring flats have sold for 159,000, 189,950, and 205,000... nice to see things rising!

See <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/property/">Folkestone property</a> and get in quick!
