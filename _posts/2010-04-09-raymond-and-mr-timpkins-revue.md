I used to go and see the Raymond and Mr Timpkins revue in Portsmouth about a million billion years ago, before I moved to London, which was before I moved to Folkestone. This is the early '90s I'm talking about, when dinosaurs still roamed the earth. They were great then, these guys must be their sons or something surely:

Raymond & Mr Timpkins Revue

Drawn together by the irresistible force of showbiz in the mid nineteen eighties, Raymond and Mr Timpkins first chose to show off aboard the Portsmouth based pop band, 'Uncle Barneys Atomic Wobblers', until the natural forces of attrition bore down and the band distilled to the current ruggedly handsome duo.

With the fledgling post-fix, "Revue", added, they blasted the clubs with their Guitar and Stylophone stylings, wowing rooms with super slick prop manipulation, dazzling jaded eyes with sandal based choreography that remains inimitable.


Their latest foray is into radio comedy/drama. A 1930s murder mystery based in Brighton and a re-tellling of the Jack the Ripper tale have so far been forged in the red hot fires of their imaginations

Rob Deering

Rob Deering exploded on to the comedy scene in 2000, reaching the Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award semi-finals, the finals of the BBC New Comedy Award and the final of the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year Competition, as well as winning the prestigious Amused Moose New Talent Award. With his easy charm, cheesy singing voice, razor-sharp wit and clownish physicality Rob has quickly established himself as a firm favourite on the london circuit and has played at all the major comedy clubs nationwide.

Joe Bor


Joe is a hugely likeable and energetic observational character comedian, whose act consists of anecdotes from his upbringing, from working in a school and from failed relationships.
