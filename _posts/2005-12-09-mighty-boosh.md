Not sure how this hasn't come up on the listings yet but cult TV extravaganza <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a> is coming to the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall+lch">leas cliff hall | LCH</a> in February... Most other dates on the tour have already sold out, so <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/945976/?affiliate=POPE">get in quick</a>!

<blockquote>Come with us now on journey through time and space to the world of <a href="/wiki/mighty+boosh">The Mighty Boosh</a>. See all the characters from the cult BBC show as they parade about in front of your naked eyes for a small fee. Witness Mr. Susan the cloth beast as he brandishes his miraculous mirror balls for your enjoyment. Recoil in fear at the evil cockney hitch hiker. Marvel at the uncanny skills of <a href="/wiki/naboo+the+enigma">Naboo the Enigma</a> as he hypnotizes you into buying merchandise after the show. Dance against your will as <a href="/wiki/old+gregg">Old Gregg</a>, the sea transsexual, lures you with his pout of doom. You will witness music, dancing and men talking to each other in wigs. You will laugh, cry and learn French. You will be changed forever yet remain exactly the same. The Boosh is loose, see it or throw your eyes in the bin.</blockquote>
