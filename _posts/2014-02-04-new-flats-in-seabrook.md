That new development in <a href="/wiki/seabrook">Seabrook</a> now has a name - <a href="/wiki/olivia+court">Olivia Court</a> -- and there are to be 22 2 bedroom apartments. Luxury, natch. I suppose the rule saying "you have to have this much <a href="/wiki/social+housing">social housing</a>" is still suspended.

Limited progress on the new development at the end of <a href="/wiki/alexandra+corniche">Alexandra Corniche</a>, it looks like a giant multi layered trench at the moment. It has not been flatted out which is suprising, so perhaps the properties there will be on two levels (some higher than others, rather than each property having stairs). I feel I should get out there and take some before and after pictures.

In other sort of related news, someone has moved the <a href="/wiki/floodlights">floodlights</a> that were pointed at the giant earth moving equipment on the beach. Instead of pointing down they seem to be pointed directly at our bedroom window now. Really lights up our house.
