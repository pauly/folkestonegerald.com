Thanks to the article in this weeks <a href="/wiki/folkestone+herald">Folkestone Herald</a> about this web page, I have had a very enjoyable hour browsing through the site.

I came to live in Folkestone in 1947 and my family lived briefly with an aunt in <a href="/wiki/clarence+street">Clarence Street</a>. Very soon we managed to rent a house in <a href="/wiki/bradstone+road">Bradstone Road</a> (The monkey puzzle houses), where we were lucky to live in a 'front' house.

I have many happy memories of the area, especially playing in the garage at the bottom of <a href="/wiki/clarence+street">Clarence Street</a> and <a href="/wiki/bradstone+road">Bradstone Road</a> and the kindness of the three brothers who owned the garage. Their surname was French. They gave us local children a big room which was used as a tyre store at the back of the garage which we turned into a club room. From this room we could gain access to the Methodist cemetary which stood on high ground between "The Brickfields" and Bradstone Road.</blockquote>
