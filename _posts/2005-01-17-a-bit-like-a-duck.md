Not read much of folkestonenet.org.uk, didn't think there was a lot to it, and the broken links seem to back this up. However here's <a href="http://www.folkestonenet.org.uk/folkestone-news/a-bit-like-a-duck.htm">an interest essay about the creative quarter</a>, and regeneration of the town in general.

"Folkestone's Creative Quarter is a bit like the proverbial duck, not much happening on top but frantic activity below the waterline or is that a lame duck with loads of spin and nothing happening at all."
