Hmm, seen something like <a href="http://www.trulia.com">this</a> before... yes, it's like my own cheap and cheerful <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/property.html">Folkestone property map</a>! Go and have a look at it please and let me know what you think. <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/property.html">The Folkestone map</a> I mean, not that American one.

If you're after a pub or something, also remember the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/">Folkestone pub map</a>. Cheers!
