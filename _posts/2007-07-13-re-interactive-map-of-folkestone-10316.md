Thank you for puting out such an amazing site!
I myself am going to make a google map API with information about the bars and pubs around our conference venue.  I have no experience in javascript, but I managed to put on markers and their info windows. However, I have trouble making a sidebar with the names of the bars and pubs. Is there a simple code with only the essentials of making a sidebar that I could use as a reference to learn this quickly?
Thank you very much!
