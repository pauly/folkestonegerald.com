I was removed from marthas because i asked a chap in a kilt if it was true that it was tradional for scots not to wear underwear under their kilts. I think this was harsh and ridiculous, and only came about because he "knew" management, i am a sia licensed officer myself, and find this an abuse of power, and have so far been unable to contact management at martha's, i think it is very unproffesional, and immature
