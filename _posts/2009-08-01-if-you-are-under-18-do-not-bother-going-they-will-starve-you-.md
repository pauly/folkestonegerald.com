On the 22nd of July i took my Girlfriend out for a meal at The Vanguard restaurant in Fareham. We sat down, chose our order from the menu, then approached the bar went to order our food, and the Waitress asked for ID in a rude manor, for food, seeing as I'm only 17 i didn't have any ID. There was nowhere that said customers had to be 18 to order food from the Bar. If you are Human you could imagine the embarrassment for myself going back to the table and saying that i was ID'D For food and was rejected the service to my Girlfriend. This totally ruined our day out. It seems as if they are going to try and starve the youths and not allow them food!! Don't Visit!!
