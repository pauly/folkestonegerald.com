<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1442178,00.html">A reality TV candidate is eyeing our town</a>

He is considering standing against either <a href="/wiki/michael+howard">Michael Howard</a>, the Tory leader, in Folkestone and Hythe or against Labour's Iain Coleman in Hammersmith and Fulham, the west London constituency, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1442178,00.html">according to the Sunday Times</a>... I feel sure he'd get in.

Seen the new "Folkstone West" signs at Folkestone West at the weekend. Not worth going out of your way really.
