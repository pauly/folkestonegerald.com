a cynic might say 'cos it's Folkestone'... Maybe it's the format - it's a bit 'mono' compared to your average forum, smileys, fonts etc - such as the Fareham example? Dunno, I check it all the time but I dont feel moved to post very often.
Maybe you should employ a Fung Shoie(however it's spelt) expert to rearrange the furniture?
