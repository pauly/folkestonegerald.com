What on earth could that be? And HOW on earth could it be? I'm still reeling from the thought of <a href="/wiki/bouverie+place+that+new+shopping+centre">bouverie place | that new shopping centre</a> opening with a pound store in it on its very first day. Now <a href="/wiki/wilkinsons">Wilkinsons</a> opens today, some good bargain drain unblocker and that but not really adding much to the town, and today the wife heard a rumour on the train that something even lower down the social shopping spectrum than what we already have is on it's way. Does anyone dare to imagine what this might be? We've already got a Woolworths, and a Lidl (or is it an Aldi)?
