<a href="http://acrusteaten.com/2014/09/09/supper-at-follies-a-supper-club-is-born-in-folkestone/">Details here</a>, more to follow. I had just about noticed <a href="/wiki/follies">Follies</a> on <a href="/wiki/sandgate+road">Sandgate Road</a> and thought it looked interesting but hadn't been back for a proper look. Best of luck to <a href="http://acrusteaten.com">acrusteaten.com</a>!

For more details checkout @acrusteaten and @follieskent on the twitter.

Thanks to @Vixxta for the tip.
