Lots in the paper this week about skaters in Folkestone, should they be allowed to skate on The Lees, are they noisy and unpleasant, is hanging too good for them etc. Here are some videos anyway.

Good skaters:

Bad skaters:

OK, they're not actually skaters in the second video, but it's young people on wheels making a noise, possibly the older citizens who live along The Lees have mistaken these rattling contraptions for a type of skate board, and it's this that's giving the skaters a bad name?
