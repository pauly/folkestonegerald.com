Bit pricey though I think. Maybe I don't put my hand in my pocket often enough, but three quid for a pint of bitter and one pound eighty for a diet coke seems a bit excessive to me.
Lovely to sit out in there garden though, it's the only place within a manageable lunchtime distance of the office, so what can you do?
