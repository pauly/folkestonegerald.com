I see there's a band of this name playing the London  Irish Centre on the <a href="http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=uk&query=search&category=misc&search=slip+gigolos&beginmonth=09&beginday=6&beginyear=2004">22nd of October</a> is that you? Or them?
That name is just on the website as someone submitted a list of the bands who were doing free gigs in Folkestone...
