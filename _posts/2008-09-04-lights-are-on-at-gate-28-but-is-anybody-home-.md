Saturday is the rumoured day of reopening, has anyone any idea if anything is really happening? I went past there on Tuesday, lights were on so someone had been inside, but it wasn't clear if anything had changed. It didn't really look closed down at all when it was closed down, all the fixtures and fittings stayed exactly on their spots.

I'm busy Saturday (going to <a href="/wiki/sandbanks">Sandbanks</a>) but please [reply]feel free to invite me[/reply] along for a free drink.
