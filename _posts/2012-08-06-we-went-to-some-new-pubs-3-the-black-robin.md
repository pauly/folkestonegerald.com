Final stop on our <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/16594/We+went+to+some+new+pubs+%231+The+Black+Horse">trying some new pubs</a> adventure, the even further afield <a href="/wiki/black+robin">Black Robin</a>. Their address is <a href="/wiki/kingston">Kingston</a>, I only know it from passing on the number 17 bus and being curious about it so it was nice to stop in. A very friendly crowd in this one, we had a couple of drinks and watched The <a href="/wiki/olympics">Olympics</a> with them. I say crowd, leaving aside the punters finishing their meals in the dining half there were eight of us in the bar, including landlord and landlady, the chef, and the barman, and us. I had <a href="/wiki/hobgoblin">Hobgoblin</a>, Clare had a cup of tea. 

A very enjoyable evening, a treat to try out three new pubs and them all be good.
