apart from pay the maintenance charges... the residents meet up regularly and agree things by committee. There's an accountant on call, but no solicitor I don't think. As I say, we're only ten flats in the one block.
Flats have been sold since I've been in here, but I've not had to answer any questions. Maybe I've got my head in the sand a bit, sorry not to be more help...
