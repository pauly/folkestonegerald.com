EXCAVATING PITT-RIVERS: Material from Caesars Camp University Centre Folkestone
Thursday 21st February 2013, 7.00pm - 8.30pm

The Town Unearthed project invite you to a drinks reception followed by a talk by <a href="/wiki/dr+dan+hicks">Dr. Dan Hicks</a> Lecturer in the School of <a href="/wiki/archaeology">Archaeology</a> and Curator of Archaeology at the
<a href="/wiki/pitt+rivers">Pitt Rivers</a> Museum, <a href="/wiki/oxford">Oxford</a>, who will be giving a talk on the site, its finds and <a href="/wiki/pitt-river">Pitt-River</a>'s work there.

<a href="/wiki/castle+hill">Castle Hill</a> or <a href="/wiki/caesar+s+camp">Caesars camp</a>  is a well-loved and familiar feature of the <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> landscape and has long been a source of fascination to antiquarians, historians and archaeologists. Excavated by <a href="/wiki/augustus+pitt-rivers">Augustus Pitt-Rivers</a> in 1878 - ably assisted by Sappers from Shornecliffe Barracks  Castle Hill is claimed as the first scientific excavation of a medieval site in Britain; despite the local name of <a href="/wiki/caesar+s+camp">Caesars Camp</a> there is little evidence of Roman occupation but more recent studies suggest it may be an even older site, dating back to the early pre-history.

For catering purposes it would be helpful to know how many people are attending. Please RSVP by clicking this link to townunearthed@canterbury.ac.uk by 19th February 2013. </blockquote>
