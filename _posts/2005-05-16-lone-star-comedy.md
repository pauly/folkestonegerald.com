A message from <a href="http://www.lonestarcomedy.co.uk">Lone Star Comedy</a>:

Hope everyone is well and you all enjoyed the frankly bizarre talents of <a href="/wiki/andrew+lawrence">Andrew Lawrence</a> last month.  We have a phenomenal line-up for this month's club (taking place this Saturday 21st May), featuring:

<a href="/wiki/richard+herring">RICHARD HERRING</a> (Richard was one half of the prolific comedy duo Lee & Herring, who were the masterminds behind both BBC TV series' Fist of Fun and This Morning With Richard, Not Judy.  He is currently performing a handful of stand-up gigs in preparation for his 2005 Edinburgh Festival show, "Someone Likes Yoghurt".  "Herring is a superior comedian" - THE GUARDIAN)

<a href="/wiki/gary+delaney">GARY DELANEY</a> (Some of you may remember Gary from his appearance at the club about one year ago; his fantastic performance then has led him to being the first act we've re-booked at Lone Star.  He is a hard hitting, one-liner based comedian whose tightly written, original material makes him one of the most quoted comics on the circuit.  "razor sharp one-liners" - DAILY TELEGRAPH)

<a href="/wiki/owen+niblock">OWEN NIBLOCK</a> (As our monthly short spot for new acts, Owen performs surreal monologues, tells laid back anecdotes and plays comedy songs on his Stick Dulcimer.    "Owen's original songs and relaxed humour were right up my street. Fab" - BBC TEESIDE)

resident compere <a href="/wiki/danny+james">DANNY JAMES</a> (he's funny, don't you know?)

SATURDAY 21ST MAY <a href="/wiki/lanterns+folkestone">THE LANTERNS, FOLKESTONE</a>
Doors open between 7.45-8pm, the show starts at 8.30pm

Tickets are available now at 8 / 6 concessions,
early reservations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (due to Richard's performance, we are expecting the show to be extremely busy) and are available by phoning 07810864228)

As far as the rest of this season goes, we will
welcome <a href="/wiki/robin+ince">ROBIN INCE</a> (starred in BBC's The Office, and performed alongside Ricky Gervais for the latter's Politics stand-up tour last year) to the club in June and <a href="/wiki/chris+lynam">CHRIS LYNAM</a> (a true circuit veteran, famed for some rather interesting on-stage antics involving fireworks) in July.  Beyond that, we'll be taking a break in August when the entire circuit moves up to Scotland and then will be back for a packed Autumn season that will include a special show for the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+literary+festival">Folkestone Literary Festival</a> in September, a Christmas gig and a New Years Eve gig.  Get your diaries out, folks.

Thanks, Tom @ Lone Star
