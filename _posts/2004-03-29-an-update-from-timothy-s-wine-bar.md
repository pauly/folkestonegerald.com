Our matriarchal representative wrote a pretty fierce letter to Timothy's (possibly as stern as our review), arranged a face to face meeting with the owner and fearlessly ACCEPTED a cheque for a partial refund for our meal. Good work!

They may possibly drop the idea of theme evenings altogether, whether that's down to our quite possibly un-noticed commentary is unclear at this stage.
