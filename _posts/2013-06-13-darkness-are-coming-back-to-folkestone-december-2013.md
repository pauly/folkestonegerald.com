Exciting stuff my sometime favourite band <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> are returning to the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a> on the 8th December. Tickets probably on sale now!<blockquote>Just Announced! East-Anglian rock-based-pop-music-band <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> are arriving at <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a>, Folkestone, this December. Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of their legendary number one debut album <a href="/wiki/permission+to+land">Permission To Land</a> - which featured the classics, <a href="/wiki/get+your+hands+off+my+woman">Get Your Hands Off My Woman</a> and <a href="/wiki/i+believe+in+a+thing+called+love">I Believe In a Thing Called Love</a> and garnered the band 3 <a href="/wiki/brit+awards">Brit Awards</a> - <a href="/wiki/darkness">The Darkness</a> will play the record in full alongside their hits from the subsequent two top ten albums <a href="/wiki/one+way+ticket+to+hell+and+back">One Way Ticket To Hell And Back</a> and last years <a href="/wiki/hot+cakes">Hot Cakes</a>.</blockquote>Do you remember when they were my favourite ever thing, ever?
