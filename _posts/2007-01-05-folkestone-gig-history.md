Been doing some gig history updates, I found some <a href="/wiki/prodigy">Prodigy</a>, <a href="/wiki/gary+numan">Gary Numan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/leatherface">Leatherface</a> gigs, and then <a href="http://www.myspace.com/petersteer">found this on a myspace page</a>:
<blockquote>In [year]1993[/year] Bonbooshe disbanded and I joined Glasshouse with Geoff and Ian Davies and spent 3 years with them recording, gigging and also supporting <a href="/wiki/gary+numan">Gary Numan</a> again on his [year]1996[/year] "Premier Hits" tour at the London Astoria. We only had 18 hours notice for this gig as we replaced the infamous <a href="/wiki/sheep+on+drugs">Sheep On Drugs</a> who had been pulled off the tour due to an incident the previous night at Folkestone.</blockquote>
What was the mysterious "incident" and where was the gig? <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/misc/gigography/1992/">I saw Sheep On Drugs around then</a>, but in Portsmouth. Loved the record, but they were shit live, think they had problems with sound limiters and stuff.
It's all gone in the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/history/">Folkestone gig history</a> section...
