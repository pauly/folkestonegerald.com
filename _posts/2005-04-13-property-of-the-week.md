Hmm, an irregular series here... Doesn't look like much from the outside, and to be fair I've not seen the inside either, but 120k for <a href="http://www.homes-on-line.com/cgi-bin/hol/showwithbanner.cgi?/kent/feed.183/full/f183_78025394.htm">two beds with a sea view</a>! How bargainous if property in Folkestone still then?

Hmm, <a href="http://www.homes-on-line.com/cgi-bin/hol/showwithbanner.cgi?/kent/feed.183/full/f183_77478440.htm">this place</a> seems to be up for 150k, and I can't see a difference between them from here. Both are still cheap compared to <a href="http://www.homes-on-line.com/cgi-bin/hol/showwithbanner.cgi?/kent/feed.183/full/f183_77090178.htm">these bad boys</a> on <a href="/wiki/sandgate+road">Sandgate Road</a>. They're new, higher spec'ed and have parking, but not sure about their spaciousness. Maybe I am spoiled.

The recently discounted new build on <a href="/wiki/bouverie+road+west">Bouverie Road West</a> is still up for sale too...
