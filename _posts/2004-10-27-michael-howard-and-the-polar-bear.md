Excellent, <a href="http://www.greenconsumerguide.com/index.php?news=2252">wind farm protesters dressed as polar bears</a>... was it the <a href="/wiki/super+furry+animals">Super Furry Animals</a>? Or maybe <a href="/wiki/dom+jolly">Dom Jolly</a>?

<a href="/wiki/romney+marsh">Romney Marsh</a> is the perfect place for something like this, it's a big desolate wasteland, and I don't live there.
