stayed here over the weekend and loved every second. welcoming, comfortable and friendly. the beer was wonderful and the bar well stocked. the family room we were in is a good size and comfortable, sleeping in a 4poster bed much like henry the viii was an experience!! we enjoyed food in the restaurant on friday evening, was busy but this did not take away the quality of the freshly cooked food. we also enjoyed the carvery on sunday before we left and that was amazing! best roast potatoes i have ever had! the staff were friendy, landlord was welcoming and cooked a brilliant breakfast and was able to tell us where in the area to visit.
looking forward to taking the family back again sooner then originally planned!
