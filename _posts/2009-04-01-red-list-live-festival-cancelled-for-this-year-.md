Friend just got a press release (I did not) the festival has been postponed until 2010 based on the unacceptable risk of doing a festival in the current economic climate. Established local festivals were expected to have a greater impact than first envisaged. Not sure people have the money to go to too many of these in the same year.

Refunds are available, see <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.redlistlive.com">redlistlive.com</a> I guess. They hope to put on a series of smaller events this year, and hope everyone will come along next year.

Um, hope I have not just been april fooled. Shit day to send out a press release! Ah this is from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=60255053581">their facebook page</a>:

<blockquote>We are deeply saddened to announce that Red List LIVE have taken the tough decision to postpone our first festival until 2010.



This is due to a number of factors, including the high risk of holding an event in the current economic climate, and the impact of increased capacity at established local festivals such as The Hop Farm.



We took the decision at this early stage, before final acts were booked, full promotion began, and site work undertaken in order to protect Red List LIVEs ability to host live events in the future.



Red List LIVE still plans to hold a series of smaller events this summer, with some of the bands already booked, before returning as a festival next year as part of our five-year plan.



All ticket holders have been fully refunded, and as a thank you for their support will be invited, free of charge to one of our upcoming events.



Please join our mailing list for further details of our soon-to-be announced events!
