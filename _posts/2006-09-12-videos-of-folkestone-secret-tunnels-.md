Just been trawling <a href="http://www.youtube.com">youtube.com</a> to see if there's any new Folkestone footage that isn't local kids beating each other up, and there is! Here's some spooky silent footage of the <a href="http://www.theotherside.co.uk/tm-heritage/background/tunnel.htm">Victorian Channel Tunnel</a>:

This is presumably the one that was abandoned because of fears of the French invading via it.
