<a href="http://www.juliajones.com">Julia Jones</a> is doing agig at Starbucks in Ashford on the 22nd of October... does this sort of thing go on a lot then? It's an acoustic performance, and I'm guessing it's free, though not sure. Something to do with <a href="http://www.thebritbustour.com">thebritbustour.com</a>
