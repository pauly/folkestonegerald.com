hello lorna, nice to hear from you,i cant figure out a way to send my email address to you without the rest of the world seeing it. no doubt there is one.perhaps if i post my mobile no.maybe paul clarke can help. the site owner.ill give it a few days and see if he comes up with something! im really busy trying to earn some dosh with my son . also develope my watercolours, as in move up a peg or two in content. i did two in the winter a couple of years back, the arts council suggested it could be a stong vein of work. i can do it. an oil painting to finish as well. i paint for me, but over the years i have sold quite a few but never made much wonga out of it. top price about 400 squid.i hope you and yours are well. my eldest girl has been ill but shes going back to work next week. some of the folkestone crowd have passed on. very sad hrd to believe. enough for now. sincerely yours trevor.
