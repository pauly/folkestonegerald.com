Yes we went to the Clarendon again this weekend, just briefly though. There were rumours of it shutting down, the brewery squeezing the landlord and the landlord unable to make enough money on it.

Also heard this week that the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1923/Sandgate%20Hotel">Sandgate Hotel</a> is to close, or at least is up for sale. You been there recently? I've been in the upstairs bar but not the clubby type bar - it's not still good now is it?
