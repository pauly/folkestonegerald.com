Shop owners tend to do market research, which is why M&S closed down, why Sainsbury's in town can't sell any of their top-end lines and why we're getting a Wilko rather than a Waitrose. You can't expect a bevvy of blue-rinse bingo-bothering biddies to turn their back on a lifetime of industrial-strength girdles and tinned food just because a few newcomers fancy a bit of a property boom.
