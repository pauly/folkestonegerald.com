Have you seen <a href="http://twitpic.com/4vfjmk">Cooper</a>?

<blockquote>Last seen Sunday 1st May. He is very friendly and handsome, often up to no good. Can you please check your sheds and garages in case he is locked in or injured. If you have seen him please call Ewen on 07859 068 940.</blockquote>

UPDATE: Hey good news, Cooper came back, he's home, safe and well!
