My old next door neighbour now runs a pub, it sounds great, we must visit. Here's what they have to say on their site:

<blockquote>The Compasses Inn is a welcoming and inviting historic old pub, traditionally and typically English, in the heart of the Kent countryside. Here in the garden of England Phil and Angela extend a warm welcome to everyone. The pub is ideal for families with its extensive, mature gardens and fun play area, plus child-friendly menu.
Inside a cosy and nostalgic atmosphere prevails with local hops which embellish the bar, fine beers and wines along with oak beams, low ceilings, open fires and everything you would expect from a 15th century inn, including a resident ghost of a hooded monk, who you might meet by the fire on a winters evening!
Excellent high quality home-made food is served along with comforting traditional pub dishes; all created using as much local and organic produce as possible and why not finish with a sumptuous, indulgent dessert?
A lighter lunch menu is available for those of you who perhaps need a quality business lunch or just to catch up with a friend for a coffee and a sandwich or an afternoon tea. BBQs will be arranged as long as the great British weather permits.
Well behaved dogs on leads are welcome in the front bar area and outside there are places to tether your horse or pony under the shade of one of our trees.
The Compasses Inn is not short on entertainment either, with clay pigeons shoots being organised on some weekends, quiz nights on the 1st Sunday of each month; open to all, bat and trap matches are held in the delightful garden during the summer months, and occasional live music performances.
