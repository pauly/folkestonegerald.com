<a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/m/12639/Kent+libraries+Amazon+Firefox+Greasemonkey+mashup" title="Amazon Firefox library mash up">See here</a>, find out if a book is available in your local library each time you visit the page on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> - brilliant!

It's a bit techie to use at the moment, you have to <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/ Use Firefox]] as your web browser, install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a>," title="Kent library greasemonkEy script"><a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/widgets/amazon_kent_library_search.user.js">install my script</a>, then go to [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007244312/?tag=clarkeology-21 a book page on amazon</a>. But I'm working on that, and hey, FREE BOOKS! And you're supporting a valuable local service!
