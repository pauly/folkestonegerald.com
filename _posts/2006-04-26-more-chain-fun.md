I've just remembered, the takeover of Ottakers by <a href="/wiki/waterstones">Waterstones</a> has been approved by whoever it is that approves these sort of things (not the staff of <a href="/wiki/ottakers">Ottakers</a> is my guess). What's this going to do for the town? Maybe <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> will move into the closed down <a href="/wiki/ottakers">Ottakers</a>...

Anyone out there work for either of these places in the town? Obviously <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=20679">be careful what you say</a>...
