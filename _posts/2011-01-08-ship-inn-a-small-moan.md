i was looking for somewhere to go new years eve.. and thouught about the ship in.. but i live in folkestone. I consider myself a regular there, its the only place i go to drink.. but probably only twice a month. I heard new years eve was just for locals.. is that me ? I had always thought it was a bit clicky in Sandgate and this confirmed it.
