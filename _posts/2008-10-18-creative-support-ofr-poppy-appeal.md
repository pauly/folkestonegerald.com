ART GALLERY SUPPORTS POPPY APPEAL IN SPECIAL WAY

The Fofu Art Gallery on Rendezvous Street in Folkestone is supporting this years Royal British Legion (RBL) Poppy Appeal in a very special way by dedicating an entire window display to Poppies and the Appeal.

Fofu Proprietor Bob Ashwood explains, The idea came from my artist wife Caroline. She recently created a series of paintings based on poppies. I thought what great way to raise funds for the Appeal.

Artist Caroline Ashwood said, From early childhood I have fond memories of accompanying my Dad as he sold poppies for the appeal in my hometown of Sheffield. 

We felt it important to support the Royal British Legion, said Mrs Ashwood, They have done so much for servicemen and women and their families for so long. The recent Heroes appeal (backed by the Sun Newspaper) has impacted on the work of the RBL. It would be awful if the Legion suffered loss of support.

The Gallery will be donating 5 from the sale of every poppy painting sold during the Appeal. Poppy paintings are selling for as little as 25. The Appeal ends on Sunday 9th November.

RBL local organiser, Mr Colin Hawkes-Horgan said that the Legion welcomed such creative support from art community.
