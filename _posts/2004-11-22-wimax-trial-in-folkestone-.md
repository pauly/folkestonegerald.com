Starting in Southern England in January, a regional network operator called Telabria Wireless Networks will begin a three-month trial in which WiMAX will carry data from an Internet backbone to towns including Maidstone, Ashford, Canterbury and Folkestone. Clients may then pick up and distribute the connection with WiFi.

Telabria <a href="http://www.telabria.com/aboutus/newsandpressreleases.html">provide / are going to provide</a> free access to libraries too. Good work!
