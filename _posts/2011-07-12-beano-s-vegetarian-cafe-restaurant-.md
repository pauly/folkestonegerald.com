Only just heard of this on the twitter, <a href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/pages/Beanos-Vegetarian-Cafe-Bar/132583610149113?sk=wall">there is a facebook page</a>, I look forward to trying it out. Maybe Folkestone is really getting there now, though I still like to go to <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> or <a href="/wiki/googies">Googies</a> if I get a chance to go out.
