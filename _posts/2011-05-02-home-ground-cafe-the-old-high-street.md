Review! great coffee,good food, love the location, but you need a very long time to wait for coffee here.. The staff are not able to do two things at once. its so frustrating... such a shame.. we have tried this place loads hoping things may improve. I want it to work but always the same terrible service, no acknowledgement or communcation at all
