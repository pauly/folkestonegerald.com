You might have seen their "Ready Steady Kook" poster up in <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> recently, or heard them in the hit parade, well <a href="http://www.thekooks.co.uk/html/">The Kooks</a> are coming to visit. It's all part of a "seaside tour", taking in coastal towns of the UK.

Date and more info as it comes in, I assume it'll be the Leas Cliff Hall. It's an odd one, looks like <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/945523/">they've already sold out two nights at the Astoria</a>...

UPDATE: Dates of the seaside tour are:

18 Aug: Hastings, Pier Ballroom
19 Aug: <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/17003C9403E1997E?camefrom=CFC_UKAFF_POPE_POPEX">Folkestone, Leas Cliff Hall</a>
21 Aug: Skegness, The Farm
22 Aug: Torquay, Riviera Centre
23 Aug: Blackpool, Spanish Hall

Must be warmups for Reading Festival, <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/17003C9403E1997E?camefrom=CFC_UKAFF_POPE_POPEX">Get tickets here</a>. For <a href="/wiki/kooks">The Kooks</a> I mean, <a href="http://search.ebay.co.uk/Reading%20tickets">get Reading tickets here</a>...
