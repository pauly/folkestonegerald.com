Not real <a href="http://www.popbitch.com">popbitch</a> (ie <a href="http://www.popbitch.com/latestIssue.html">the popbitch newsletter</a>), just something someone just posted on the board. I repeat it here for your delectation and delight:
<blockquote>Meanwhile, on the last train out of <a href="/wiki/charing+cross">Charing Cross</a> on Saturday night...

Your actual <a href="/wiki/cheryl+baker">Cheryl Baker</a> out of <a href="/wiki/bucks+fizz">Bucks Fizz</a> (and thinning hair advertisements) being accosted by a horde of very drunk 40-something Folkestone slappers on their way home from the <a href="/wiki/scissor+sisters">Scissor Sisters</a> gig in <a href="/wiki/trafalgar+square">Trafalgar Square</a>. She was utterly charming to them, posed for photos, put up with their rambling 80s reminiscences, guard-defying smoking, mobile phones playing out <a href="/wiki/snow+patrol">Snow Patrol</a> on speakerphone etc. And got off at <a href="/wiki/sevenoaks">Sevenoaks</a> with her friends. One of the more battle-scarred ladies got off with a likely lad from Dover whose technique included the classic exchange: "43 are you? Well Id still do yer up the arse" "Oooh dont you be so rude, young man" "Oh, sorry, I thought you said you was from Folkestone..." Cheryl laughed.</blockquote>
