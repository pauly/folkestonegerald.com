Ta for that, not sure how it ended up here, but this is in response to an old post of mine about <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/blog/22/27/">the death of Jack "The Hat" McVitie</a>, who was killed at <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/cgi-bin/board.cgi/97%20Evering%20Road%2C%20Stoke%20Newington">97 Evering Road, Stoke Newington</a> in October 1967.

No actual Folkestone connection, no need to panic anyone... Any more info on this, please <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/cgi-bin/board.cgi?mParent=2227">please post it here</a>. Did you know who lived there after you?
