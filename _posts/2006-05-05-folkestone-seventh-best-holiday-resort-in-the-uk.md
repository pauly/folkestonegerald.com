<blockquote>Sam Hill, spokeswoman for the Camping and Caravanning Club, which has an amazing 400,000 members in the UK (most of them stuck in front of me on the motorway), recommends Folkestone and the Kent coast. "It's gorgeous," she says. "There's an excellent campsite right next to the beach and lovely cliff-top views. You have easy access to all the coastal areas and <a href="/wiki/france">France</a> is just a short hop away if you want to take a day trip." The town of <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> may not, it is true, be that exciting, but nearby <a href="/wiki/hythe">Hythe</a> has the world's smallest public railway - trains are a third of the size of normal ones - running 14 miles across <a href="/wiki/romney+marsh">Romney Marsh</a> to <a href="/wiki/dungeness">Dungeness</a>. Children in your party may also be interested in nearby Port Lympne Wild Animal Park, which has the largest herd of African elephants in the UK.</blockquote>

I'm sure that person also got their campsite into a <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=best+campsites+in+the+world">best campsites in the world</a> chart in a national paper recently, excellent PR journo manipulation skills to whoever was involved!
