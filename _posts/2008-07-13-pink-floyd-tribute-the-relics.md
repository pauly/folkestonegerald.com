hello my name is tracey, i live in dover & on sat 12th july i went to the louis armstrong where the relics were playing. i thought they were absolutely brilliant. The maen on the drums, keyboard & guitars were fantastic, & the 2 girls singing were really good. the blonde girl was stunning. thankyou relics for a really good night xx
