<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakito">Voici wikipedia</a>:

<blockquote>Pakito is the alias of French Eurodance artist, Julien Ranouil. He became known thanks to his cover of Living on Video by Trans-X. Later hits are "Moving on Stereo" and "Are U ready". So far his music style can be best determined as Euro House. His name is from Paquito chocolatero, a famous pasodoble dance from Alicante, in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain.</blockquote>
