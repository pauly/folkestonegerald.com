Here at Karl's, we are always looking for ways to help our customers in the way of incentives, generous offers and/or discounts. For example, we do not charge corkage or restaurant mark-ups on wines served in our cafe, for a long time we offered a free Americano coffee with every lunch, we often run coffee/pastry/cake deals and where possible, we offer free tastings of as many products as possible, to mention a few.

We have also been approached by various groups such as students, university staff, OAP's, Fireservice, NHS, local businesses, etc requesting discounts for their associates. However, in practice, the problem we found in offering discounts to one or two of these groups meant that others were demanding why they were excluded - fair point.

So, in an effort to keep everyone happy, we think the best and fairest solution is to offer all residents of the Canterbury District (including Whitstable and Herne Bay) a discount via the local Residents Card Scheme. Basically, if you are over 18 and live in the Canterbury district you qualify for a Residents Card which entitles you to a host of special offers throughout the district. Click here for further details.

For several weeks now, we had been offering 10% off lunch Monday to Wednesday, but we are now extending this offer.
Improved offer in our cafe and NEW offer to include shop purchases

We are now delighted to offer Residents Card Holders the following offers:

    * SHOP OFFER: 10% off when you spend 30 or more in our shop. This offer is applicable 7 days a week
    * CAFE OFFER: 10% off your lunch bill, Sunday to Thursday inclusive. Lunch is served 12:00 to 15:30

We really encourage you to get a Residents Card as there are more and more businesses signing up to the scheme and in uncertain times ahead.....don't make me say this, but every little helps!


Best Regards

Karl
