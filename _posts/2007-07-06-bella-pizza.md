Service was unprofessional, rude, arrogant and unapologetic. My wife and I did not spend more than 5 minutes in the restaurant before we walked out. We have eaten in restaurants in Florence, Siena and other parts of Tuscany, and have never met such appalling service. This restaurant does not live up to the reputation of friendly Italian service and hospitality.  We won't be going to this restaurant again or recommending it to any of our friends. We went to Portofino Ristorante instead (better professional and friendly service).
