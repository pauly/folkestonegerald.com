I recommend <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/45/Escondido">Escondido in Sandgate</a>, always, although <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2184/Tinto+Tapas">Tinto Tapas in Sandgate</a> is also good (this is based more on friends recommendations as I've only been there once). <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/58/The+Hermitage">The Hermitage</a> sounds like it might be just about right though, in terms of ambience and specials.
