didn't see any of it myself, a shame as it was filmed in Folkestone, I'm led to believe all the tantrums are just put on for the camera. Today's Sunday Mirror is far less pleasant, <a href="http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17716789&method=full&siteid=62484&headline=just-stick-to-the-night-job--nikki--name_page.html">and they say</a>:

<blockquote>Mixing with seamen on a Folkestone trawler, the little fraud pretended to puke at the sight of the writhing catch of the day.

Later she showcased her all-round uselessness working in a fish and chip shop.

Hey Nikki, why don't you stick to something you're good at - [deleted, just in case]!

This show is an insult. Make it stop.</blockquote>

Such vitriol!
