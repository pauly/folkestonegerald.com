Sounds good, seen a couple of things in the paper about people making films locally, good luck with finding something locally.

I (not Steve T) am still commuting daily from the West End of Folkestone into London, it's exhausting innit? I am being made redundant at the end of the year, so hopefully something closer to home will come up then, or I'll get enough freelance stuff to see me through (web development, if you know of anything..?).
