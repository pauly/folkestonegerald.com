***THE JANNA GOODWILLE BAND***
Janna Goodwilles songs, with their honest lyrics, blend of alternative acoustic jazz-influenced pop, and the soulful arrangements with which she delivers them, have captivated audiences in her home country of England, UK; in parts of NE Spain; and as far a field as Arizona, Nevadas Burning Man Festival, and Californias west coast music scene.

2008, 2009 & 2010 saw Janna Goodwille & Friends - James Hewins (double bass), Alex Foster (lead and rhythm guitar) and Jon Bongly (percussion), supported by Premgeet Andre (backing vocals & cello), Justin Jackson & Dr D. (percussion), Lydia Polzer (flute), Stewart George (sax), Geoff Sheridan (trumpet), Liz Jones (Violin), Fran Loze (cello) and Jack WhistlecrAFT (beat box) - playing over 80 gigs at Festivals across the UK (including a phenomenal 11 gigs in 4 days at the Edinburgh Fringe 08), around London town and delighting an increasing local fan base at Janna Goodwille & Friends' monthly residency at World of Music Revue Nights in Greenwich. Audiences have been enraptured by both the message and the music. One inspired music-lover at Secret Garden Party said Janna Goodwille & Friends was quite simply the best band Ive seen in a very long time.

***DUNCAN DISORDERLY AND THE SCALLYWAGS***
Along side being in a band called "laffin" he plays lead guitar for "keltrix", an alternative folk rock band, sings in "Chukin" a ska reggae band and performs as a "one man band" under the name "DuNcAn aN DisorDeRly."

Live, as "DuNcAn aN DisorDeRly," he uses an Rc-50 loop station and a kaos pad 3 together with a guitar, a melodica, beatboxing and vocals to create a rather unique sound. Combining the sounds of reggae, ska, hip hop, drum and bass, techno, gypsy and more.

This time his latest incarnation alongside some close friends is 'Duncan Disorderly and the Scallywags' incorporating all of the above with live musicians.

***THE HIGH PRIEST***

Are you ready to be entertained? Mr Motta, now known as 'The High Priest' began his music career in the stables of Some Bizarre, run by one in the last of maverick music managers, Stevo Pierce (Soft Cell). After the release of the critically acclaimed first album 'Picture That', Motta decided to leave the label and release his own works.

Twelve albums later of acoustic, hip hop and live albums, we now see Motta with a new backing band; 'The Brotherhood'. An electric 3 piece that has been noted as being reminiscent of Iconic figures such as Dylan, Eminem and Bill Hicks.
Rejected by the BBC, reviewed by every major media outlet in the country and releasing 2-3 albums per year, makes The High Priest one of the most interesting and different acts around

***JESS***

Solo artist Jess from the south east is a new discovery, and my what a discovery she is! Her self penned material would normally be associated with an artist with much more experience. She has a truly amazing and captivating voice, which combined with her well crafted lyrics make for a mesmerizing performance. 


***IAN GEAR***

Ian Gear (Paul Tingey), is a comedian who has had some moderate success in America and hosts a show 'Ian Gear in Gear' on his local radio station (web FM)! however he has now come to take over Great Britain and wants to share his showbiz stories with you, especially what it's like being an American living in this little country of yours!

Basically The Bar Below is one of the most relaxing, well laid out places Ive ever come across. It is rapidly gaining renown as a truly unique venue having held some fantastic music events already such as 'Underground Sound' and 'The Loco Lounge', to name but a few. The acoustics are great and the staff friendly and helpful, theres even a STAIR CHAIR for those who find stairs difficult. It's also decked out with nice comfy sofas for those wishing to take the weight off their feet !
