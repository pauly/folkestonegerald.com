<blockquote>The formal consultation with Shepway continues, but Shepway's web site is very difficult to negotiate through. For help and tips on how to respond to the consultation please use the advice on the Save <a href="/wiki/princes+parade">Princes Parade</a> web site:

<a href="http://saveprincesparade.org/local-plan-consultation-issues-options/">saveprincesparade.org/local-plan-consultation-issues-options/</a>

I have to say it took me a few attempts before I managed to post my comments, so I put together an "idiot's guide" (mainly for my own use:because I'm an idiot!)

You can read the full consultation document and respond to it using Shepways portal here:

<a href="http://shepway-consult.objective.co.uk/portal">shepway-consult.objective.co.uk/portal</a>

This takes you to a Large Table and it is Policy No. C9 the concerns the Princes Parade Development

This only takes a few minutes, once your registered youre ready to write your comments. Best of luck with it. This is our last chance of stopping Shepway at this stage, if they suceed in the consultation, it will become increasingly difficult to stop any development on Princes Parade.
