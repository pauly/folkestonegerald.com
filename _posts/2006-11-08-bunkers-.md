<a href="http://sub-ex.blogspot.com/2006/11/cold-war-roc-bunkers.html">Some cold war bunkers here</a>, in Folkestone of course, fascinating stuff!

<blockquote>Cold War ROC Bunkers
These bunkers were situated a various points around the country and would have been manned by members of the Royal Observation Corps in the 1960s, who would have reported back to the HQ in the event of a nuclear war. The interiors are mainly very similar, with one or two rooms and some are complete with the original contents.</blockquote>

Doesn't look like they've been inside the Folkestone bunker...
