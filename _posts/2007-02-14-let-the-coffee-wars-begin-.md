<a href="http://danhassett.blogspot.com/2007/02/starbucks.html">Councillor Dan Hassett</a> says <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> <a href="http://danhassett.blogspot.com/2007/02/starbucks.html">are definitely coming to Folkestone now</a>:

<blockquote>There has been much speculation about <a href="/wiki/starbucks">Starbucks</a> opening in Folkestone. I can finally confirm that they will be opening in the new <a href="/wiki/bouverie+place">Bouverie Place</a> shopping centre. They have applied for permission to extend opening hours to 7am-10pm and to have an outdoor seating area.

A bank/building society/Bureau de Change will also be opening in Bouverie Place. There have been rumours that HSBC is moving in. It's a large unit spread over two floors.</blockquote>

Costa's a bit pricey, and the queues are too long / slow, and Starbucks often has better food. Let the games commence!
