I have totally taken my eye off the ball. <a href="http://festival.hevy.co.uk/">Full lineup here</a> for the <a href="/wiki/hevy+festival">Hevy Festival</a>, it's not one for the faint hearted is it? 

<a href="http://festival.hevy.co.uk/tickets">Get tickets here</a>, 69 for a weekend camping ticket, 33 for just the day, or 89 for a "total" ticket, give you zoo access and a t-shirt and other goodies... see the <a href="http://festival.hevy.co.uk/tickets">Hevy tickets</a> page for more.
