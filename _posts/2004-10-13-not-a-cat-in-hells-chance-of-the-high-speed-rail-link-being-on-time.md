<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/transport/story.jsp?story=571591">says The Independent</a>... also "It is thought that the only way of guaranteeing full trains would be by keeping the cost of tickets down. Ministers still hope that a premium rate can be charged for the super-fast services, possibly double the rate paid on comparable routes on the far slower suburban network"... NO, do it on time and keep the fares down!
