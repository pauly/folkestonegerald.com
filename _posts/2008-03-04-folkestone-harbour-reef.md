Just spotted someone looking for <a href="/wiki/folkestone+harbour+reef">Folkestone Harbour reef</a> on this site, and I managed to rescue this info on surfing in Folkestone from the google cache of a deleted <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent">bbc.co.uk/kent</a> page:

<blockquote>John - die hard local
Folkestone harbour beach has been going off for ages; surfers just dont know how good its been! So you all need to get down here as soon as magic seaweed shows the low pressure in the North Sea.
