Hi there

Well as you probably know <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1923/The+Sandgate+Hotel">the Sandgate Hotel</a> closed down for a refit (coincidentally not long after the Ramsay Kitchen Nightmare programme). So was interested to go there when it reopened. It now looks much better inside - they've knocked through from bar to dining room and it feels more spacey. Downside in my view the food. When we went all the meal options were very dry and tasteless (very few options with sauces) and there was a bizarre pricing policy - a few dishes were at the 6-7 level and the others were 10-12. I was really hoping it would be a viable alternative to Bar Vasa (which yes we all love but it would be nice if there was at least one other place we could go on the seafront that is good value and has a view!). Oh they also didnt cook my friends meatballs properly - some of them were raw on the inside.

Still its a nice option in the summer if you can get to sit on the terrace .....
