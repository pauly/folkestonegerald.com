What was / is The Sound Lounge then? <a href="http://www.cabe.org.uk/default.aspx?contentitemid=254&aspectid=23">This case study from CABE</a>, regarding the building of the SAGA HQ in 1998 mentions it. Did it come and go? Or is it now known by another name?

<blockquote>Already there are early signs of success. On the harbour is Chummy's seafood stall. Strange Cargo, a carnival and celebratory arts company is established in its offices and gallery in the Old High Street. The Sound Lounge, a music venue, has recently opened in Tortine Street. The Metropole Arts Centre provides a focus for the visual arts and acts as a motor for the creative quarter, the plans for a new sculpture park on The Leas and the burgeoning Folkestone Literary Festival.</blockquote>
