My new favourite pub. My husband and I have been all over the UK staying at inns and seeking out old worldy country pubs, this one was the best hands down. (I'm American and he's from London so it's been kind of game to find the best.) The pub itself is the most well preserved pub I've ever been in. It has a big open hearth with a real fire, candles, period furniture, welcoming proprietors, and well cooked food. It was fantastic and we will go back again and again. Only 1 hours drive from Southwest London. My husband and I used a 2005 guide of to find this pub. Any changes occuring from change in ownership would have happened by now. I had never been here before but after reading others reviews, I do not know what some people are complaining about. 10 out of 10!
