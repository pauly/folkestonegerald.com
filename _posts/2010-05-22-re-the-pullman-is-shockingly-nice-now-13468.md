We had a nice long walk in town and decided to have a cool of in The Pullman. Went in there about a year back and they let us in with a kid.  Yesterday (21.5.2010) we tried to go in again and were told that they don't allow kids in with a somewhat snotty attitude from the bar staff lady.  And this was about 1500-1600.  Its not like we would have let the kids run around or anything as we wanted to sit in the garden but we could not even do that.  I hate to say it but they will NEVER see me back there if they want to be that way.
