I thought it might be from last week's trailer, <a href="http://www.radiotimes.com/ListingsServlet?event=10&channelId=132&programmeId=39786449&jspLocation=/jsp/prog_details.jsp">Radio Times confirms it</a>:

<blockquote>After last week's subdued start to the new series, <a href="/wiki/gordon+ramsay">Gordon Ramsay</a> is much more in his element, unleashing hell at the <a href="/wiki/sandgate+hotel">Sandgate Hotel</a> on the south coast. It's losing 2,000 a week, and Ramsay quickly identifies a string of serious problems...</blockquote>

Didn't work did it, it's closed / closing / changing hands isn't it?
