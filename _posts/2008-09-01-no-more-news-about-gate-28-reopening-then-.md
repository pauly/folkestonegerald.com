I found nothing on <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, except a group saying "wouldn't it be good if it reopened"... it's still under offer, and still has not changed internally so I guess it could happen fairly quickly. If you have any more specific info please [reply]post it up here[/reply]...
