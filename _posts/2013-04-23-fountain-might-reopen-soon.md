I have been doubting if it would open at all but there seems to be lots of work going on there, the doors have been open and people have been working inside, and there's scaffolding all over it so the outside is getting a spruce too. One thing that made me doubt it's recovery was the wording saying <a href="/wiki/fountain">The Fountain</a> being taken down, but I hope that is just so that can be decorated too.

If it was not a pub what could it be?

I suspect there is going to be lots of development just around this area over the next few years. There is a big plot where <a href="/wiki/seabrook+police+station">Seabrook Police Station</a> <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22420011@N05/2874053647/">picture</a> used to be (before my time) that has been cleared... I hope it's something palatable that is built there and not some cheapo flats.
