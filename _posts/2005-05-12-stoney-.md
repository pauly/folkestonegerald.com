err.. dunno if I like it, evokes a picture of Dungeness/Greatstone? I'm sure I picked up 'Folky' from this forum - hands up who coined it! Price hike, when I got my deeds and stuff I saw what the seller had originaly paid for my place - cripes, they had trebled their profit in 6 years. Could do with a Tardis and pop back 10 years and buy half a dozen places and still have change for a curry?
