<blockquote>TWO dolphins trapped in fishing nets off the south coast have triggered a massive rescue operation..

The British Divers Marine Life Rescue - the team who tried to save a whale stranded in the Thames in January - are leading the bid to save a pair of bottle- nose dolphins that swam into trouble off Folkestone, Kent, yesterday morning.
