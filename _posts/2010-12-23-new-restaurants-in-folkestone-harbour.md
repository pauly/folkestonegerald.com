I'm not really up to date with what's going on in Folkestone, though everyone does seem to expect me to know. Guess I set myself up a bit! Just found this on Twitter:

So I'm opening two restaurants next May and they are going to be on the harbour at....FOLKESTONE in Kent. One is a fish and chip shop with rooms which is the old smoke house and one is being built on the harbour as we speak. Need a name for the restaurant so ideas welcome! </blockquote>
