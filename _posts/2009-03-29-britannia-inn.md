Having booked for six adults and two children and making is clear that one child would need a high chair and having been told that this would be fine when I made the booking.  We arrived to be told that they do not have a high chair.  We put the two year old child on a regular chair with cushions but there was no apology for being misinformed.  Food was not good either - roast chicken arrive on the bone which several of the party refused, parsnips were raw and the stuffing was dry and unappetising.  Puddings were just about okay but no one could tell us which ones contained nuts and which did not.  Would not go again or recommend to anyone.
