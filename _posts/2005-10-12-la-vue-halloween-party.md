Missive from La Vue:

<blockquote>We Have a great Halloween party on the 29th October it's a Saturday. It's a fancy dress competition, 10.00 per person to include first drink, buffet, D.J downstairs and entry into the competition.  First prize is a weekend for two in either <a href="/wiki/barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/wiki/prague">Prague</a> or <a href="/wiki/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. Other prize categories are sexiest outfit, best Gangster, scariest outfit, most unusual outfit Best Superhero, which all carry a prize of a bottle of bubbly. Should be great fun. </blockquote>
