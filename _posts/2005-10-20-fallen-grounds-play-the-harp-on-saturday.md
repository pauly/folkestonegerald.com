Just having a play with <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> and I found a gig at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/34/Harp%20Club">The Harp Club</a> for Saturday, <a href="http://events.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.detail&eventID=27473.42268&Mytoken=091D0196-A217-457C-8E892AD66EE0581150386406">Fallens Ground and two other bands are playing</a>... Enjoy if you go, we are going on a bit of a crawl around town, will be in <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> at some point. OK, so you don't know who I am, but if you see a group of people, who look like they're on a bit of a crawl around town, please be kind to them.

Good luck with the gig and that!

If you have a gig coming up, and <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">it's not listed here</a>, <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/cgi-bin/calendar.cgi?table=event&mode=add">you know what you have to do</a>...

Oh also, enjoy <a href="/wiki/supergrass">Supergrass</a> if you're going tonight!
