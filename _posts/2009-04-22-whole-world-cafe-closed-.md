The Wife went past yesterday and says it's closed down. Sign says they've ceased trading at that address (or similar wording), but does this mean they've moved elsewhere?

It's a shame, it was a nice place, the sort of place we could do with around here. It was not without it's problems though, I did quite often feel I was inconveniencing the person serving when I asked for food or a drink.

Hope something equally vege and music scene friendly opens up in its place.
