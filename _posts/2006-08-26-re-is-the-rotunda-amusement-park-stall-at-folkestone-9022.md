If it's still there it's not there for long, it's being demolished and redeveloped any day now. There was a temporary travelling fairground on the site on the last bank holiday. Can't see the Rotunda from where I'm sat, so that's the best information I have to offer...

UPDATE: We went there today, it's still standing and there are some working fair rides on site.
