It's next door to <a href="/wiki/metronome">The Metronome</a> isn't it? I'll dig out the history that I have... there's a book you can get in <a href="/wiki/ottakers">Ottakers</a> called <a href="/wiki/more+tales+from+the+tap+room">More Tales from the Tap Room</a> and it has a history of local pubs / hotels of the past...

This is it isn't it?

I didn't just take that btw, I am not following you! I snapped it a few months back when it went up for sale, I was thinking the front of the pub might be changed more, and it would be lost forever.
