<a href="/wiki/sellindge+festival">Sellindge Festival</a> are doing a "battle of the bands" type thing to pick local bands to play there, first heat is at the Frenchman on the 22nd of January. More details from the press release follows. Nothing rude about <a href="/wiki/zoo+thousand">Zoo Thousand</a> / <a href="/wiki/red+list">Red List</a> this time.

<blockquote>Hundreds of applications, loads of incredible bands; who knew there was this much talent in our corner of England? After a search for the best live performers in the Southeast, Sellindge Music Festival has announced the competitors of the Main Stage Talent Tournament: Heat 1, being held on Thursday, 22nd January in Folkestone. The decision was grueling, but in the end, five bands were chosen to compete for a once-in-a-lifetime spot on the Main Stage of Sellindge Music Festival 2009. Five more bands will battle it out during Heat 2 on 12th February, then four finalists (two from each Heat) will play their hearts out for the big prize on 14th March.
