Just wondering whether you could let me know the best sources for getting to know more about:

a) The hiogh speed train link

b) The squabbles between Godden and Dehaan over the seafront

I'm from Folkestone originally and looking to pick up 1 or 2 investments flats... and i think there's still price headroom given both of the above. What are forum thoughts on prices?

Cheers
