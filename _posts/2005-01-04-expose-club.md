Looking for details of the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1768/Expose+Club">Expose Club, Canterbury</a>... <a href="/wiki/radiohead">Radiohead</a> played there, if the [google=radiohead gigography]many Radiohead gigography sites[/google] are to be trusted, but I suspect that one mistake in any of them would have been copied across the whole lot...

The date in question is 26th Jan [year]1993[/year]... Was it the name of a night at an established venue like <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1769/The+Penny+TheatreThe">Penny Theatre</a>? Or at the uni? I know <a href="/wiki/radiohead">Radiohead</a> played <a href="/wiki/canterbury+uni">Canterbury Uni</a> in 1992, supporting the <a href="/wiki/frank+and+walters">Frank and Walters</a> but this is a different show... Anyone help?

On a barely related <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> note, the city was nearly host to <a href="/wiki/nirvana">Nirvana</a>, according to this quote on <a href="http://www.nirvanaclub.com">nirvanaclub.com</a>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=andy+pearson">Andy Pearson</a> - <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fear+loathing+fanzine">Fear & Loathing fanzine</a>:
"Me and a couple of friends used to put on bands at [fg]Canterbury Art College[/fg], and were offered Tad and <a href="/wiki/nirvana">Nirvana</a> as a package. The idea was they would be driving back from the European leg through <a href="/wiki/dover">Dover</a>, and they could stop off in <a href="/wiki/canterbury">Canterbury</a> on the way to the [fg]Astoria[/fg]. We were offered both bands for 350 quid. But the Social Secretary wouldn't underwrite it." </blockquote>
