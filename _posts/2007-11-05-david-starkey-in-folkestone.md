Went to me first <a href="/wiki/literary+festival">Literary Festival</a> event yesterday, <a href="/wiki/david+starkey">David Starkey</a>'s talk at the new academy. It was good! The talk, not so much the academy, it's nice and modernlooking but there is a bit of a prison quality to it.

<a href="/wiki/david+starkey">David Starkey</a> lives round this way, did you know that? He said "nine miles" from where the talk was (<a href="/wiki/folkestone+academy">Folkestone Academy</a>), so where does that make it? Further than <a href="/wiki/saltwood">Saltwood</a> which would have been my guess, out in the sticks somewhere. Maybe <a href="/wiki/etchinghill">Etchinghill</a>?
