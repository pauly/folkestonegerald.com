Watching the terrible film <a href="/wiki/about+time">About Time</a> last night, where the lead character gets to <a href="/wiki/time+travel">time travel</a>but only in his own life time. So where / when would I go? Yes, right now to this <a href="/wiki/black+flag">Black Flag</a> gig as I have been listening to them, and never seen them, easy win. But, I would have been twelve years old at the time. They surely would not have let me in. So no.
