Did you see Folkestone on the BBC news last night? <a href="/wiki/john+prescott">John Prescott</a> came to town to unveil a monstrous poster of <a href="/wiki/michael+howard">Michael Howard</a> with the slogan "Forward not Howard". Where in town did this happen?

Here's what <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/maps/february_2005.php?ctid=2839">Labour say they've done for Folkestone</a>, here's <a href="http://www.shepwayconservatives.org.uk">Shepway Conservatives</a>, and here's <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/party/people/person.html?id=52&navPage=ppcs.html">Peter Carroll</a> of the <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk">Lib Dems</a>. Last, but most closely allied to my own beliefs <a href="http://www.greenparty.org.uk">The Greens</a>. The candidate is <a href="/wiki/hazel+dawe">Hazel Dawe</a>, and the mayor recently defected their way from the <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk">Lib Dems</a>. Also standing are <a href="/wiki/petrina+holdsworth">Petrina Holdsworth</a> of the UKIP and <a href="/wiki/rodney+hylton-potts">Rodney Hylton-Potts</a>, the independent TV game show winner.
