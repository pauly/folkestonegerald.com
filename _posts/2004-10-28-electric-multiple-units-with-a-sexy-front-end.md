<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1337423,00.html">The Guardian has the story about the Folkestone bullet trains</a>, and confirms the idea that they'll only be ready for 2009:

The timetable for the trains has slipped by two years. The Strategic Rail Authority hoped to launch local services by the time the Channel tunnel rail link carries Eurostar trains to London's St Pancras station in 2007.

Read the rest of the story for more, all the papers are likely to be running this... can I wait until 2009 for property prices to boom though?

Oh, also:

Roger Ford, the technical editor of Modern Railways magazine, said: "These are not really bullet trains. They're electric multiple units with a sexy front end."
