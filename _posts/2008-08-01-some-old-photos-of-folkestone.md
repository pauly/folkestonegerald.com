<blockquote>I bought an album of photos not so long ago and these photos of [gmap]Wear Bay Road[/gmap] and Folkestone were included in it. I thought you might like to see them and possibly pass on the the ones of Wear Bay Road to any residents of houses featured. I don't know who was living there at the time. Anything you could tell me about the photos would be appreciated.
Yours sincerely David Wichbold</blockquote>
