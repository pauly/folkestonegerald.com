Britannia Hotels have just bought the Grand Burstin Hotel from Grand Leisure Hotels, and show flats in that crazy crescent down on the sea front should be available to view any time now, one bed flats from only 89,500 and the three bed duplex penthouse for 249,500 I think... that bit of Folkestone is on the UP! Whatever they do, let them leave arm wrestling night at The Harbour alone...
