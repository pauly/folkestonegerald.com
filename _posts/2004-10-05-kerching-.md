So <a href="http://www.money.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2004/10/05/cnsaga05.xml">Roger De Haan raised more than a billion yesterday</a>, by selling Saga to Charterhouse... 

Staff will receive a 1,000 cash bonus for every year of service, which is nice for them, and that nice for the town, where some of that money will be spent... Also nice for the town is that the 1,200,000,000 profit is also likely to be spent here... More restaurants please Rog!
