Clare is wishing she had not found <a href="http://www.folkestoneherald.co.uk/NAMED-SHAMED-Shepway-restaurants-pubs-takeaways/story-24518135-detail/story.html">this article</a> about food hygiene standards locally... I had decided to stop eating at a certain <a href="/wiki/chinese+takeway">Chinese takeway</a> locally as I saw they had scored three out of five, but LAWKS-A-LAWDY <a href="http://www.folkestoneherald.co.uk/NAMED-SHAMED-Shepway-restaurants-pubs-takeaways/story-24518135-detail/story.html">look at how many places</a> get zero stars or one star! Lots of places we have been to and like, including <a href="/wiki/cheriton+balti">Cheriton Balti</a>, <a href="/wiki/thailand+tom">Thailand Tom</a> and <a href="/wiki/terracotta">Terracotta</a>! There's more to it than just "count the number of bugs", it's a complex process including managerial competence and venue layout and things apparently. I will do more digging and post more details when I have some time.

Good to hear that my top favourite (that I never find time to visit any more) <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> scores the max five out of five! I used to think that everyone basically got five stars until I saw a three out of five in someone's window but now I know the truth...

I'm going to integrate those ratings and logos with <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/">The Folkestone Gerald</a> as it looks quite easy to do, but until I get round to that <a href="http://ratings.food.gov.uk/">Why not search for your favourites here</a>...
