Yes  this restaurant  has  good  food,but rather music  loud.

The part of my critisism is the Bar and waitress staff  very clinical and feel you are doing them a favour being there,  also  the Female waitresses  are obviously in competion with each other for the male barmans effections, little more on service and less thinking whats happening when they close  !!!!
