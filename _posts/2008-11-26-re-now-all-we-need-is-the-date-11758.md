sorry to come to this really late...but the Metronome was a great venue...and indeed, i can confirm i saw the following bands there...
cardiacs/levitation
kingmaker (supported by Suede in the week The Drowners was released)
manics (don't remember it being poorly attended, but it was rescheduled and was final date on their tour around generation terrorists...and you could quite clearly see richey's razor blade scars from his 4 Real incident
PJ Harvey (before she started applying make-up
Kitchens of Distinction
went to loads more...but can't remember them

Also, i saw the Ride /Mercury Rev Leas Cliff Hall show...i know the London date a little later had the Verve as support. Mercury Rev were very rocky and a bit shite ...amazed they turned out so good in the end!
