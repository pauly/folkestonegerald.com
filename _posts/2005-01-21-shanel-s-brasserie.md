To Whom It May Concern,

I have no idea who it is that does the write up on resteraunts on your site but i'm afraid to say that they are truly mistaken as to the standard of service or the standard of culinary delights that are on offer at the resteraunt. I have been fortunate to have eaten at 'Shanel's' a fair number of times and can say with all honesty that all the members of my groups have fully enjoyed the congenial atmosphere and friendly service availible at the brasserie. It would appear that the critique submitted was from somebody looking for faults when there was none, but nonetheless saying anything to fill the column. 
All i can say to anyone is , try it and you will see for yourself. The large amount of repeat business the resteraunt has is tantamount to its good food, not to mention continually friendly staff.
