Plea over fast rail link
10 October 2004

Campaigners in Folkestone are urging railway bosses to introduce a fast rail link to London as early as possible.

Shepway District Council had expressed its concern to the Strategic Rail Authority at the loss of momentum since operator Connex lost the franchise.

The authority has said a new operator for the service will be appointed within the next few months.

I've not actually noticed any protesters, but RAH! London is starting to notice Folkestone!
