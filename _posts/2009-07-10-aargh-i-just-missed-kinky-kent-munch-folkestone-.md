<blockquote>Kinky Kent Munch, Folkestone

We will be meeting in The Castle Inn again for the seventh Folkestone Munch. Last time over 30 people came along and we all had a great evening. As you walk in from the street, go into the lounge bar (NOT the Dungeon Bar!!), and we have a large area furthest from the bar, but we'll have an A to Z of Kent map book and a teddy bear in bondage on our table, to help everybody find us. Its a semi private area so this is good, and they are happy to have a group using it. Please be aware that the bar does have locals so please do remember that this is a vanilla venue.

Or did I? @JacksonRocco says it's on the 10th. Would be embarrassing to turn up in bondage on the wrong night...
