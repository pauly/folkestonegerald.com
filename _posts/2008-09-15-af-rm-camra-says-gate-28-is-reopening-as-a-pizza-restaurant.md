Not sure if that info is more up to date than what <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=17850512485 I read on Facebook]]. This is from <a href="http://www.camra-afrm.org.uk/index.php?page=marsh-mash-online">the September issue</a> of <a href="http://www.camra-afrm.org.uk/index.php?page=marsh-mash-online">Marsh Mash, the newsletter of Ashford, Folkestone and Romney Marsh</a>" title="The Campaign for Real Ale">branch of [[http://www.camra.org.uk CAMRA</a>:

<blockquote> The bad news, The Fox Willesborough was firmly closed when visited in June and the Gate 28 in Sandgate, which closed in February, is to become a pizza restaurant. Whilst the Pullman Folkestone and the Captain Howey in New Romney both have notices "closed until further notice" in their windows, more information would be appreciated. The Railwaybell, Folkestone is closed to be turned into a Tesco Express.</blockquote>

I see they also have <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/">a database driven map now</a>, competition eh?
