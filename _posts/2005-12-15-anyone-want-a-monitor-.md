It's a 17'' regular CRT monitor, and it works fine. I want a flat panel monitor, but I can't really justify buying one until I get rid of this one. Any idea what I can do with it? I can't really chuck it out of the window because there are cars below. Charity shops won't take things like this I'm sure, and I'm not going to just take it to the tip as there's nothing wrong with it.... I'm not allowed to get a new one unless I get rid of the old one, our flat is cluttered with too much kit already.

Is anyone likely to want to upgrade from a 15" monitor to a 17"?
