<a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news.asp?article_id=25857">Kent Online article about it here</a>... They're also closing the Chatham branch, which is doubly worrying. First it implies a similarity between Chatham and Folkestone, and secondly

<blockquote>The closure of the M&S store in Chatham High Street will deal a severe blow to regeneration hopes for the town centre.</blockquote>

What about the regeneration hopes for Folkestone town centre..? Everybody out, close down the town centre and set up camp down <a href="http://www.folkestoneharbour.com">the harbour</a>!
