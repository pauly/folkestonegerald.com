An email from Brian:

<blockquote>I played at <a href="/wiki/mick+s+flamenco">Mick's Flamenco</a> in June July or august 1967 !!

Does anyone know of any posters/handbills/archive records

The band was called the <a href="/wiki/honey+band">Honey Band</a> and  we did a lot of <a href="/wiki/eddie+floyd">Eddie Floyd</a> / <a href="/wiki/bobby+bland">Bobby Bland</a> / <a href="/wiki/jackie+wilson">Jackie Wilson</a> / <a href="/wiki/wilson+pickett">Wilson Pickett</a> / <a href="/wiki/otis+redding">Otis Redding</a> and <a href="/wiki/james+brown">James Brown</a> Stuff

Anyone recall ??

it was also advertised in the <a href="/wiki/nme">NME</a> - but I can't find copies????

Thanks
