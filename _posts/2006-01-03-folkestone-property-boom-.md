<a href="http://www.ourproperty.co.uk">ourproperty.co.uk</a> has it that a flat near me (Folkestone West End) just sold for 205,000! That's quite a lot of cash for a flat around here isn't it? It's one of the new ones on Earls Avenue, just how big are they then? I think this must have broken the ceiling price for this road.

One of my neighbours went in for a look and thought they were a bit small, they looked very nice but not huge in the online brochure... this is sure evidence of the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/property/">Folkestone property</a> boom.
