There's a new Camden style retro shop opened in Folkestone. Today was the first day of opening, just low key at the moment, they're going to launch properly in a couple of weeks, I'm sure they'll [reply]invite me along for the champagne reception[/reply].

Unfortunately I completely forget what it was called :-( It's on the road where <a href="/wiki/pullman">The Pullman</a> is that goes to The Bayle. Check them out. The counter is a ship-shaped cocktail bar, and they sell the kind of clothes you wish you could find in charity shops.
