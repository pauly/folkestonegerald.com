Friends of <a href="/wiki/kent+foundation">Kent Foundation</a> Member, <a href="/wiki/andy+coveney">Andy Coveney</a>, took part in a gruelling 55 kilometre

running and cycling race and raised money for <a href="/wiki/kent+foundation">Kent Foundation</a> for young entrepreneurs.

Rolling up his sleeves and getting on his bike Andy completed the ordeal in 3 hours 21 mins

and hopes to raise around 100 for his efforts.

After the race Andy said:

<blockquote>I'm really pleased I finished the race, especially as I thought I might not be able to start because of an injured leg</blockquote>

Director of <a href="/wiki/kent+foundation">Kent Foundation</a> for young entrepreneurs <a href="/wiki/paul+barron">Paul Barron</a> congratulated Andy:

<blockquote>It was a fantastic commitment, Kent Foundation's future relies more and more on support from the private sector, and individuals like Andy. This is part or our strategy for securing a future for Kent's young business people</blockquote>

I am not entirely sure who <a href="/wiki/paul+barron">Paul Barron</a>, <a href="/wiki/andy+coveney">Andy Coveney</a> or <a href="/wiki/kent+foundation">Kent Foundation</a> are, but I got a press release and it looked official so here you go. I assume you can find out more at <a href="http://www.kentfoundation.org">kentfoundation.org</a>.
