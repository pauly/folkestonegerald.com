Hmm, bit more <a href="/wiki/gig+history">gig history</a> confusion... <a href="http://www.space-trash.co.uk/ride/92.htm This Ride gigography]] says <a href="/wiki/ride">Ride</a> played Folkestone on the <a href="http://www.space-trash.co.uk/ride/92/920321.htm">21st March, 1992</a>. Now I look into that properly, it says support came from <a href="/wiki/mercury+rev">Mercury Rev</a>" title="Verve | The Verve / Richard Ashcroft">(and not <a href="/wiki/verve+a+which+i+got+from+somewhere+a+href+http+homepage+mac+com+aaront+ride+old+ride+live+html+this+full+ride+gigography">verve</a>, which I got from somewhere). <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/aaront/ride/old/ride/live.html This full Ride gigography</a> backs it up, so does <a href="http://members.cox.net/divercity/rev/revshows.html">this Mercury Rev gigography</a>," title="Manic Street Preachers | Search the forums for mentions of The Manics...">and they all confirm that the bands were elsewhere on Sunday March 22nd and Sunday March 29th.

Mostly just thinking out loud here, and making notes for next time I can't remember where the info on the site came from, excuse me.

SO, the <a href="/wiki/manics+a+date+in+folkestone+is+still+a+mystery+also+where+did+i+get+the+idea+that+verve">manics</a> date in Folkestone is still a mystery! Also where did I get the idea that [[Verve</a> supported? Off on another quest...
