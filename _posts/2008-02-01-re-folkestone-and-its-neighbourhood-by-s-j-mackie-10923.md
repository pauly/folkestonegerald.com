I don't know about the "low price" bit, but it's easy to [abe=mackie+folkestone]get one from ABE Books[/abe], it'll cost up to one hundred pounds, though [abe=mackie+folkestone]there's one here for less[/abe]. I didn't yet buy one, even though I said two years ago that I definitely would. I'm still [ebay=mackie+folkestone]looking out for one on ebay[/ebay], if I find one I'll certainly post <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/folkestone/8/board.html">here on the forum</a>. Good luck tracking one down.
