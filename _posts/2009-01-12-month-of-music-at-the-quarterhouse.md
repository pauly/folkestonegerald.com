Oh not actually a <a href="http://www.monthofmusic.co.uk">Month of music</a> (though you can win a guitar there), but music on Fridays and Saturdays for a month:
<blockquote>Every Friday and Saturday evening throughout March, Quarterhouse in Tontine Street, Folkestone will host Music Month - a series of diverse music nights.
Featuring a variety of bands, solo artists and musical acts, we want to showcase the type of music you can expect to see regularly at Quarterhouse. From folk to rock, pop to indie and electronica to jazz, whatever your tastes we want you to come and help us celebrate Quarterhouse's first month! Look out for one of our Music Month postcards and enter our competition opposite for the chance to win a guitar and be one of the first to receive the full Music Month programme in the new year.

I thought it was going to be a music venue? I hope there's some good stuff there...
