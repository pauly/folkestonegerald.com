Walking around <a href="/wiki/grimston+gardens">Grimston Gardens</a> at the weekend, saw a flat that's available by auction... will be a bargain for someone, lovely location and that. According to <a href="http://www.cliveemson.co.uk/listings.asp">Clive Emson's listings</a>, one that sounds like it sold last week for 76k. Also what's this "Former town centre club with planning for pair of houses, 195k", also sold, could that be the <a href="/wiki/metronome">Metronome</a>?
