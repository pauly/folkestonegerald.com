I heard she did, she must do she is a <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/fundraising-bid-to-save-listed-101693/">high profile supporter of the Leas Club</a>. Some interesting stuff on that link, not just about <a href="/wiki/june+brown">June Brown</a>.

There is a <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/save-the-leas-pavilion-stage-one/">crowdfunding campaign</a>. Would you like a wing of the restored <a href="/wiki/leas+club">Leas Club</a> named after you..?
