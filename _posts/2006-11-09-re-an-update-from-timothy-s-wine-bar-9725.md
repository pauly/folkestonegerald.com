Tim's wine bar has now certainly changed! I dined there last week and I have to say that I could not fault the place.  We were taken good care of. We even received a visit from the owner (Tim) who, is a fellow wine fanatic, talked for us for a few minutes about the wine we were drinking. The food was very tasty and the staff were great. If you are planning an evening out in folkestone this is certainly the place to start.
