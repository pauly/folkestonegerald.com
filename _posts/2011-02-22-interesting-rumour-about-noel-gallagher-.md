There always seems to be a rumour about someone famous moving to Sandgate... Nice new house being built just by <a href="/wiki/clarendon">The Clarendon</a>.

So was the <a href="/wiki/true+briton">True Briton</a> called that before it was called <a href="/wiki/harbour">The Harbour</a>? That's not so bad then...
