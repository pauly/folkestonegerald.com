Trying out a new <a href="/wiki/folkestone+property+prices">Folkestone property prices</a> thing from <a href="http://www.ourproperty.co.uk">ourproperty.co.uk</a> - lets me have live updates in the sidebar over there, do you see? If you don't see a table of average prices over the past six months then it means I've got bored and removed it... It's only updated once a month, so a bit pointless really, but maybe I can do something funky with the <a href="/wiki/xml">XML</a> they're promising.

UPDATE: By XML, they mean that they use <a href="/wiki/xml">XML</a> somewhere in the back end, it's not really an <a href="/wiki/xml">XML</a> feed, all they offer is the javascript... You can grab this data yourself from <a href="http://www.ourproperty.co.uk/scripts/partnerstats.php?town=folkestone">ourproperty.co.uk/scripts/partnerstats.php?town=folkestone</a> and do what you like with it I suppose...

See my <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/property.html">Folkestone property price map</a>.
