Can you tell me the link where you saw this?

UPDATE:
<blockquote>NEW! Saturday 19th January 2008 - 'THE GOLDEN ARROW' to Folkestone and Canterbury
Departing from:  Coventry (06.40/23.30) Leamington Spa (07.20/23.10) Banbury (07.45/22.50) Bicester North (08.05/22.35) Haddenham & Thame (08.20/22.25) Princes Risborough (08.30/22.15) High Wycombe (08.45/22.00) Ealing Broadway (09.20/21.15)
This is a train with a real wow factor that any steam enthusiast would not want to miss as we take a circular tour of over 200 miles hauled by Southern Railway Battle of Britain Pacific 34067 Tangmere complete with the Golden Arrow flags & regalia.  Features include an enchanting winter journey through the picturesque garden of England and along the White Cliffs of Dover  with a stopover of around two hours to discover medieval Canterbury, the highlight of this tour being the 1 in 30 steam hauled climb up the soon to be closed branch from Folkestone Harbour. During the time in Folkestone we have arranged an additional photographic run up the fearsome incline enabling passengers the rare opportunity to view this historic event from the harbour side.
