One resource that seems invaluable in <a href="/wiki/folkestone+history">Folkestone history</a> terms would seem to be [abe=mackie folkestone neighbourhood]A Descriptive and Historical Account of Folkestone and Its Neighbourhood, with Gleanings from the Municipal Records[/abe], quite a mouth full, usually referred to as just [abe=mackie folkestone neighbourhood]Mackie[/abe] (or [abe=mackie folkestone neighbourhood]Folkestone and its neighbourhood[/abe]. That has a mention of <a href="/wiki/radnor+club">The Radnor Club</a>, on page 97, <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~folkestonefamilies/mackie.htm">this index to it</a> says so...

I've found this research quite fascinating, I didn't realise how easy it would be to [abe=mackie folkestone neighbourhood]get a copy of the long out of print Mackie[/abe], I'm getting one.
