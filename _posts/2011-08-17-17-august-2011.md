Disappointed.  We had a beautiful bit of fish, nicely cooked that was destroyed as a meal by chips that were either re-heated or kept warm under a light for a long period of time.  The chips were chewy rendering the wooden implements virtually useless  The meal sat heavy.  We had high hopes of a an 'upmarket' fish and chip shop.  The surroundings were modern but stark; service was poor and ultimately the product was overpriced.
