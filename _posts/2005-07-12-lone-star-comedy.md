The final Lone Star Comedy Club until the Autumn is on Saturday July 16th! Appearing on the evening will be <a href="/wiki/chris+lynham">Chris Lynham</a>, <a href="/wiki/tom+price">Tom Price</a>, <a href="/wiki/simon+douglass">Simon Douglass</a> and the fabulous MC <a href="/wiki/danny+james">Danny James</a>...

All usual ticket information applies - see <a href="http://www.lonestarcomedy.co.uk">lonestarcomedy.co.uk</a>

The club returns in September as per usual - we have a special midweek one-off show for the <a href="/wiki/folkestone+literary+festival">Folkestone Literary Festival</a> and a special Christmas show planned for this Autumn season so it's sure to be a special one.
