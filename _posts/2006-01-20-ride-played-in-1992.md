They played the Leas Cliff Hall, supported by Verve, it's on my <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/1992/">Folkestone '92</a> page. 

Can't find the Manics gig on any fansites or anything, though I've heard other people say they were there. There was one gig lined up, then it was cancelled, then they played a week later. I can only think they stopped in on there way to the continent or something.

I'll check again, maybe I was looking a couple of years out when I investigated before...
