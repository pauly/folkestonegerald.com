Got an email from <a href="/wiki/karl+s+good+food">Karl's Good Food</a>:

<blockquote>Just a quick one to let you know we will be at this year's Eurofair held in the Dane John Gardens in Canterbury from tomorrow, Friday 24 to Sunday 26 September.

You can find us in marquee No 2 where we will be exhibiting a fantastic line-up of wines.

Hope to see you there and have a nice weekend. </blockquote>
