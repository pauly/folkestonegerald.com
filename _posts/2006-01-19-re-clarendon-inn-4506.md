hello pauly, the clarendon is one of the best Folkestone/environs pubs. In my youth c. 1992-1994 the place to be for the indie type crowd in Folkestone however was The Sandgate Hotel down the hill. It was a proper scruffy dive bar/pub with a cracking jukebox and bands on. pics from NME etc all over the walls.
