Basically The Bar Below is one of the most relaxing, well laid out venue's i've come across. There's even a stair chair for those who find stairs difficult. The very next day there's a mini festival 'The light festival' details of which can be viewed at <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=482463109">profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=482463109</a>
