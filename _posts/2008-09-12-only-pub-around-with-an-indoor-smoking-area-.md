Went to the Skuba Bar last night and sat in their new conservatory for the first time. We had two smokers with us who were very pleased to see they've found some kind of loophole against the smoking ban. The walls of the conservatory can be opened right up, so they don't quite count as walls, and the roof can be rolled back too, but to all intents and purposes it seems to me this is an enclosed are.

They have lots of heat lamps inside, but it was still a bit chilly for me, so we headed off to Chambers.
