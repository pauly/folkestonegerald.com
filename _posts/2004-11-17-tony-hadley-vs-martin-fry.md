23rd Feb sees <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/cgi/asp_events/byid.asp?event_id=1700396DA9ED8BE4&category=CONCERTS&affiliate=POPE">Tony Hadly vs Martin Fry</a> at the <a href="/wiki/leas+cliff+hall">Leas Cliff Hall</a>. In some sort of fight I hope, wrestlemania, and not singing. What do you reckon?
