<blockquote>Creative Foundation is pleased to announce the dates of , which will return for its fourth edition and will be held over a nine week period from 2 September  5 November 2017. Curated for the second time by Lewis Biggs, the Triennial in 2017 will take the title double edge.  
   
The concept of double edge will further develop the inquiry into sense of place that guided Folkestone Triennial exhibition, Lookout, in 2014. double edge refers to the two main axes around which Folkestones development as a town has taken place historically and geographically: the seashore and the Pent Stream, an ancient watercourse flowing from the Northern Downs into the sea, the present edge between East and West Folkestone. The title draws on the extensive academic study of edge concepts in recent years: borders; thresholds; margins; the periphery; the liminal. double edge resonates with major contemporary cultural, economic and political realities experienced as part of everyday lives in Folkestone and across the globe: migration; border control; wealth inequality; sustainability; a challenging urban environment; and climate change, to name a few.

Internationally recognised artists will be commissioned to make new contemporary artworks exhibited in public spaces around the town. Artists will be invited to engage with Folkestones various narratives and material memories drawn from the towns social, cultural, political and economic history. Some artworks will become permanent additions expanding the towns permanent collection, Folkestone Artworks, built up since the first edition of the Triennial in 2008. All artworks that make up Folkestone Triennial are commissioned with the ambition of positively affecting the urban ecology of the town as a place to live, work, visit and study.</blockquote>
