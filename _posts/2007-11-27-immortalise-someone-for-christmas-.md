If you are immortalised in oil, next time someone says 'you're no oil painting' you will be able to cut them dead when you produce before their very eyes the Christmas present you got for your wife in 2007 - a picture of yourself! - Actually, Kev (of <a href="http://www.ezeetiger.com">ezeetiger.com</a> fame) was recently commissioned by a guy to do a pic of his wife from a photograph as a surprise present to her and she LOVED it! so if you're stuck for unique presentage this Christmas. . . .
