Heard of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mapplets">Mapplets</a>? No? Used <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Google maps</a> though haven't you? Wouldn't you like to add the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/">Folkestone pub map</a> without having to visit this site? You can! <a href="http://maps.google.com/ig/add?synd=mpl&pid=mpl&moduleurl=http://www.clarkeology.com/widgets/mapplet.xml">add it to your map</a>. Now you can find a local pub (or in lots of other towns actually) from with Google maps itself. Brilliant!

Here's what it looks like:

I have to make that link to Flickr, <a href="http://flickr.com/guidelines.gne">it's the law</a>.
