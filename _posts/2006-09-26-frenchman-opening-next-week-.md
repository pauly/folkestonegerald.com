Not that I've spoken to anyone or anything, but I see these gigs coming through on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/gigs/">the listings</a>:
Thu 5th Oct 2006 <a href="/wiki/heroes">Heroes</a>
Fri 6th <a href="/wiki/sharpee+s">The Sharpee's</a> (should that apostrophe really be there..?)
Sat 7th <a href="/wiki/clacket+lane">Clacket Lane</a> TBC
Fri 13th <a href="/wiki/turmoil">Turmoil</a>
Sat 14th <a href="/wiki/mary+s+dog">Mary's Dog</a> (that one's right)

Had a look through the door today, as I thought it might be open this weekend. The place is still all upside down, but looks on schedule. It's not changed drastically inside, just looks new and clean, some of the old decor is intact.

Connected with The Frenchman in some way? [reply]Leave a message[/reply]... If you'd like to vote on which of those gigs is likelly to be the best, please go to <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/gigs/">the full Folkestone listings</a>...
