Just went past <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a> and now it is <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a>! Not sure if it's open yet, but looking forward to finding out. 

So will another restaurant move in to the old <a href="/wiki/escondido">Escondido</a> space, would it be a success? Was <a href="/wiki/la+bougie">La Bougie</a> a success when it was in that building before? Bit before my time really...
