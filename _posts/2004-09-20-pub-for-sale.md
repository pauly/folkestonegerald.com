As <a href="http://www.clarkeology.com/stokey/19/70/">previously reported</a>, <a href="/wiki/mustang+s">Mustang's</a> is up for sale. 70,000 for a ten year lease, and for that you get a 50% share of the fruit machine profits.

It's been many things in just the brief time I've been visiting Folkestone, I hope someone can turn it into something cool... I'd like to see it become a fancy chain pub I think, an <a href="/wiki/all+bar+one">All Bar One</a> or something, town could do with one of those. While most towns are keen to have less chain bars, Folkestone's not at that stage yet, we want to get them in so we can start complaining about getting them out!

Anyway, I guess just ask at the bar if you have 70k burning a hole in your pocket, though I wouldn't advise carrying it round that bit of town in cash... If you buy it, please install some real ales.
