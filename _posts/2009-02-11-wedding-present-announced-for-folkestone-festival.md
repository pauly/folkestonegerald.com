Think the organisers of <a href="http://www.redlistlive.com">Red List Live</a> might struggle to get advanced ticket sales for the festival, following the chaos of the <a href="/wiki/zoo8">Zoo8</a> festival on the site last year. Apparently it's <b>not</b> the same company organising the fest, it's just the same location, so headliners pulling out on the day because they'd not been paid etc hopefully won't be repeated.

Other acts confirmed so far include <a href="/wiki/undertones">The Undertones</a> (without <a href="/wiki/fergal+sharkey">Fergal Sharkey</a> I'm sure), <a href="/wiki/archie+bronson+outfit">Archie Bronson Outfit</a>, <a href="/wiki/white+rose+movement">White Rose Movement</a>, and <a href="/wiki/klaus+says+buy+the+record">Klaus Says Buy The Record</a>. No mention yet of <a href="/wiki/gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> (<a href="http://www.portlympne.com" title="Port Lympne">it's a zoo</a>, GEDDIT???)

See <a href="http://www.redlistlive.com">redlistlive.com</a> for more details.
