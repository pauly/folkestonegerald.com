Saw the tail end of Customs and Excise jumping someone near the fishmarket yesterday afternoon,remind me never to try and smuggle anything, looked pretty painfull having three heavies landing on top of you without warning.Scared the cr*p out of my wife who thought it was a fight breaking out. Haven't a lue what it was all about, but suddenly there were customs and excise people everywhere.
