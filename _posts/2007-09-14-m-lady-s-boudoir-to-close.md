The designer ladies outfitters on the <a href="/wiki/old+high+street">Old High Street</a> is to close, or at least to move somewhere other than F<a href="/wiki/olkestone+old+high+street">olkestone Old High Street</a>, <a href="http://rosspmmiller.blogspot.com/2007/09/end-is-in-sight.html">one of the shop owners blogs here</a>...

I don't often pass up or down the <a href="/wiki/old+high+street">Old High Street</a>, but when I did a couple of weeks ago I noticed another shop I'd recommended here (which I forget the name of now) has closed, it seems to have been reposessed by the <a href="/wiki/creative+foundation">Creative Foundation</a>. It is a bit early for all these businesses really, good on them for being early adopters, Folkestone will get there in the end.
