The prince of india in folkestone is my favourite resturant to eat, whether its take away or eating in they always serve up good grub!
There is friendly service on the phone and excellant in the resturant.
The delivery people come quick and are very polite.
The food is amazing with lots of choices for vegetarian and english dishes, but the curry is the best in the world and i hardly ever eat anywhere else for curry as they never fail to impress (:
The resturant has comfy chairs and nice loos with a clean and neat appearance.
I love it there as you can see :D
thank you ali!
