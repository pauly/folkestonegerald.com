The gig on Friday was halted apparently because of fighting in the crowd! When the scrappers were eventually removed from the hall they were shouting threats back at Mr Gray. 

Were you there? Did you see anything? Call Folkestone Gerald in confidence on 0800 fg@folkestonegerald.com. Or post it up on youtube,  I just posted up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/folkestonegerald">my footage from The Cure at Wembley</a>...
