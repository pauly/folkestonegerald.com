Someone on <a href="http://www.mrgig.com">mrgig.com</a> says "I officialy bought the last ticket for the Ordinary Boys gig yesterday. I tried to buy two but there was only one left". So it's long sold out, what did I tell you? There's always a slim chance of returns or try for <a href="http://search.ebay.co.uk/Ordinary%20Boys%20Tickets">Ordinary Boys Tickets</a> on ebay... Wish I'd bought a dozen now.
