Folkestone is 700 years old today. I didn't get this until it was too late:

<blockquote>Since the <a href="/wiki/charter+of+incorporation">Charter of Incorporation</a> in <a href="/wiki/1313">1313</a> Folkestone has been able to elect their own mayor; to mark this historical occasion the Town Council is putting on a celebratory event and an evening of historical talks.
 
From 11am-3pm there will be a series of performances and music including historical theatre and a medieval band outside the Leas Cliff Hall.  The Town Hall will also host a programme of talks detailed below.
 
 
Programme for Wednesday 17th July at Folkestone Town Hall (1-2 Guildahall Street) is as follows:
 
7 - 8 pm                  Dr Andrew Richardson - Canterbury Archaeological Trust
8 - 8.30 pm            Eamonn Rooney -  The homes of the Town Council through the years and
                                 some notable past Mayors
