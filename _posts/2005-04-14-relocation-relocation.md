Good to see Folkestone not only feature on Channel 4's <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4homes/ontv/relocation/">Relocation, Relocation</a> last night, but also being the outright winner! What a great house. Shame they didn't have time to give as much blurb about Folkestone as they did about <a href="/wiki/deal">Deal</a> and <a href="/wiki/ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>. Also a shame the guy's not commuting into London. I commute into London, it's not that bad!

The winning property was a five bed Victorian townhouse, on with <a href="http://www.fellreynolds.com">Fell Reynolds</a> for 595k, which they got for 518k! Not bad! Can't find it online, but it was called the "Manor House" somewhere, so guessing it's on <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?Grid2Map?X=622376&Y=135940&title=Manor+Road&back=Folkestone+Gerald&url=http://www.folkestonegerald.com">Manor Road</a>...
