Was going to try and put together some stuff about the changes to the entries in the log files of this site, seems <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> are updating the way they grab pages from this site, but I'll link to <a href="http://www.pidster.com/blog/">Pid's blog</a> instead... Check out <a href="http://www.pidster.com/blog/">What does "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible)" actually mean?</a> for starters. If you're interested in that sort of thing.

Now, how can I be sure that Google indexes this site properly and ranks it fairly? We're being penalised for some reason, the <a href="http://folkestone.clarkeology.com">old URL</a> is being used in preference to the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com">new one</a>...
