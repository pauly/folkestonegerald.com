It's not me, I am not the manky badger, but I found <a href="http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-tQ4bzqE8eqiptkeweTQwZEiJsfaca83g?p=769&n=25480">this blog</a> talking about a trip to <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a>, and how <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> had changed...

<blockquote>We lived in <a href="/wiki/folkestone">Folkestone</a> from September 1984 to April 1986, so I consider myself something of an expert on all things Folkestonian. It has to be said that the place has changed somewhat in the intervening twenty one years. The wonderful aquarium shops are gone, as is "Eureka" - the place which sold absolutely everything really cheaply. <a href="/wiki/hmv">HMV</a> is no longer in the basement of <a href="/wiki/debenhams">Debenhams</a>, and <a href="/wiki/wh+smith">WH Smith</a> has lost its top floor. <a href="/wiki/rotunda">The Rotunda</a> and the scenic railway are gone. In fact there's not a lot left apart from <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> bar and the ice cream shop.</blockquote>

So we had an <a href="/wiki/hmv">HMV</a> before did we? I've only been living here 3 or 4 years and visiting for a few more before that... <a href="/wiki/chambers">Chambers</a> hasn't really been around that long either, it was called the <a href="/wiki/sub+club">Sub Club</a> about ten years ago. Still nice to get a few more hints of <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/history/">recent Folkestone history</a>...
