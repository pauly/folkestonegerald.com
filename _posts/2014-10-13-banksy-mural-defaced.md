<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-29594273">Interesting</a>, another phase to the saga of the <a href="/wiki/banksy">Banksy</a> work in <a href="/wiki/payers+park">Payers Park</a>.

More interesting, BBC says the original work shows a lady looking at an empty plinth, she's not looking at an empty plinth in my view, she's looking at the grey paint which has been elevated on a pedestal. Am I wrong? Were the big grey rollered patches painted there by Banksy? I think there are others on that wall that are not part of this picture, I'm sure that's how it looked when I was there... Can't go back for another investigate this weekend as I'm busy.

UPDATE: Of course the <a href="/wiki/banksy">banksy</a> is now gone from Folkestone :-(
