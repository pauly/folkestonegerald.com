Seems it wasn't a joke, there's a new issue of <a href="http://www.shanerecord.com">Shane Record</a>'s 'zine <a href="/wiki/other+three+quarters">The Other Three Quarters</a> out now. Maybe it will expand and take over where <a href="/wiki/quarter">The Quarter</a> leaves off. It's good that he's just doing it for fun and not expecting to run it for a profit or anything.

Shane if you're out there, I can provide you with <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/gigs/">listings and things</a>, just help yourself from the site or get in touch, pauly at folkestonegerald.com.
