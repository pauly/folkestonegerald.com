It's only been open the last couple of years.

Who was in Folkestone in <a href="/wiki/1985">1985</a>? Not me.

I don't have much info about that time, but <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/history/1985/">I know</a> <a href="/wiki/hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> played in town that year. But then, they played every year.

Good luck with the novel.
