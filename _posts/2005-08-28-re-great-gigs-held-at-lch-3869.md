It was around Summer 1989 and they were great. I must've caught one of their eyes (ouch) as I was personally invited back stage. I crept off (unbeknownst to my then boyfriend 'Bones') and innocently went back stage when they;d finished the gig.  The first thing after asking my name was to offer me abig fat Bob Marley (spliff) I na do dat ting, I said, had a sip of one of their beers and got hastily rushed off by my x's sister, whod'd come looking for me as 'Bones' was worried because I'd dissappeared!  Needless to say it was a memorable gig and Aswad were tops!
