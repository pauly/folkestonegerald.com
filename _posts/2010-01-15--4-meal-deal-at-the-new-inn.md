<blockquote>Several important announcements are now available on our updated website www.new-inn.info

    * 50% discount on food available to anyone crossing the Channel this month.
    * To combat the wintry weather we have introduced a terrific 4 meal deal until end of March.
    * The 'Early Bird' 8.00 menu offers a super range of options for the evening - including traditional roast.
    * Special events such as Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Cocktail Party Dinner and Race Day for the springtime.
    * Finally, the pub was redecorated in early January. You will continue to see further improvements in early 2010 including soft furnishings being installed in the bar area.

To see more, visit us online at: <a href="http://www.new-inn.info">new-inn.info</a>

Finally, our New Year's resolution is to strive to improve customer service beyond measure. This year, we aim to widen our menu choices even further to include a range of delicious international dishes never before seen at The New Inn. May we take this opportunity to wish all our customers health and happiness for 2010, and extend our sincere thanks for your continued support.

Best wishes,
Kevin & Joyce
