Went for lunch a few days back and was delighted and impressed at how lovely it is. The staff were very nice and the both of us had an excellent, excellent meal. The ability to sit out back in the sunshine was a nice bonus. Enjoyed it so much am taking a group of six there next week for supper. I can't speak for the other comments nor their experience but ours was excellent and the owner was quite kind and helpful with our menu inquiries.

Can't wait to go back again!
