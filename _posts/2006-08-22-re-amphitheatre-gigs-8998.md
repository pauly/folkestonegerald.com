Hello I have just found your site whilst looking for info on Folkstone Amphitheatre and cant see anything mentioned about the gigs this weekend. This is a copy of the posting from <a href="http://www.jax.org.uk/php/events/">jax.org.uk/php/events/</a>

Saturday 26th August 2006
"Folkestone Hootenanny", with Siete Leguas (Alternate country meets Cow Punk), The Rattlers (Acoustic music combo), Bid & Frink ("Sweethearts of the Rotunda with harmonies that soar to where the air is thin and the spirit all consuming"), Fat River Band (Country), Relig Oran ( Trio singing European, English & Irish songs) and The Buick Six (Country blues to finish the festival)
I'm playing in one of the bands and it would be good to get some feedback.

I beleive Hullabaloo are playing the following day Sunday 27th.
