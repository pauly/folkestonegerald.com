<a href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a192181/eurostar-give-schiffer-extra-help.html">according to Digital Spy</a> Claudia Schiffer received special treatment during <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8423871.stm">the Eurostar debacle of the last few days</a>, being allowed off at Folkestone while other passengers were not. Lucky her!
