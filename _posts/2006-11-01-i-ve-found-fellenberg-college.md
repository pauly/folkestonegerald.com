It's now mostly a shop called Pickwicks! Here are some pictures I took of it, looks like it's been at least partly demolished. Here's a view up Church Street, towards the Church, Fellenberg College is on the right where Pickwicks is now.

Here's a straight on view of the building, looks like it's been at least partly demolished, possibly it was bombed during the war.

I did notice that on the same street there's a plaque to <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=william+harvey">William Harvey</a>, he lived (and was possibly born, I forget) in a house on this street.
