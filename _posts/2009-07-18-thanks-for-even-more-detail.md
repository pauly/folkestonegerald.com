Great to hear, nice story of nearly "making it" too, that's a lot further than 99% of bands get!

Just thought, I wonder if <a href="/wiki/black+sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> played twice in Folkestone around that time? As the first gig I added here for [year]1970[/year] was supposedly at the <a href="/wiki/art+college">Art College</a>. Not sure where I got that info from, possibly <a href="http://www.marmalade-skies.co.uk/">Marmalade Skies</a>... <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?cof=T%3Ablack%3BLW%3A550%3BALC%3Ablue%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.marmalade-skies.co.uk%2Fmslogo.gif%3BLC%3Ablue%3BLH%3A146%3BAH%3Acenter%3BVLC%3Ablue%3BGL%3A0%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.marmalade-skies.co.uk%3BAWFID%3Ac8a7ebacc522c35a%3B&domains=www.marmalade-skies.co.uk&q=folkestone&sa=Google+Search&sitesearch=www.marmalade-skies.co.uk">lots of folkestone there</a>...
