The Woodville Halls seems to be undergoing a change for the better with a comedy club, high profile names, new seats, spanking new bar and on site cafe.  I attended the comedy night which was set for an intimate atmosphere with the headline act Hattie Hayridge (previously on Red Dwarf as Holly the computer) and it was fantastic.  I understand that the comedy is going to continue (hooray!) and that the Ministry of Sound might be visiting.  Worth a visit these days!
