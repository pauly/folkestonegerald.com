I was there last weekend and had the burger while my friend had the sirloin steak. The chips are still soggy I'm afraid. The burger was not bad enough to send back, but certainly not good enough to go back for. Questionable meat, cold bun, otherwise good.
The place is right next to Sandgate road, which is quite busy. As the front door is wide open, the atmosphere is a bit like eating outside, next to a motorway rest stop.
Downstairs is not really fit for purpose as a dining area of a place with such a high ambitions.
Service was excellent though. Just close the door and sort out the chips and I'll give you another chance. Can't recommend as is though.
