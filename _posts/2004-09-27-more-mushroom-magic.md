<a href="http://www.bedgeburypinetum.org.uk/">Bedgebury Pinetum</a> was one of the places we unofficially had a bit of a look for mushrooms the other day... if you fancy ago without being chased off by the gamekeeper, they organise official events there, with a chance to eat what you find:

<blockquote>Sunday 3 October

Sunday 10 October

Saturday 16 October

<a href="/wiki/bedgebury+pinetum">Bedgebury Pinetum</a> will again be holding its seasonal and popular Fungi Foray events on Sunday 3, 10 and Saturday 16 October 2004 between 9.30 am and 1.00pm.   The cost will be 25 per head including lunch and is suitable for everyone over 12. The money raised will go towards the Bedgebury Pinetum Development Fund.

The event will start with coffee and cakes on arrival before expert George Niklas guides enthusiasts with boxes and baskets into the Pinetum and surrounding forest to forage through the undergrowth looking for edible mushrooms to take home.

After the two hour walk Chef Richard Martin who manages the Pantry at Bedgebury, will don his chefs whites to serve a delicious mushroom lunch with wine.

Booking is essential and can be made by calling the Pinetum Shop on 01580 211781.  Wear boots and waterproofs bring a basket and a knife.</blockquote>
