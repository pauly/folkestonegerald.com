If this site had a <a href="/wiki/clubs+and+societies">clubs and societies</a> section, stuff like this would definitely be in it:

These Print Competitions have ended our 2006/2007 season, with only our Annual Dinner and Awards Night to follow on 25th May.

The above winning photographs, scoring 20 points, can be seen on our website at <a href="http://www.folkestonecameraclub.co.uk">folkestonecameraclub.co.uk</a>

We are certainly doing well  within the club we now have, among our members, A.R.P.S., L.R.P.S., C.P.A.G.B., and D.P.A.G.B. award and competition winners of acceptances and prizes, we are without a doubt among the top clubs in Kent now, not only for our members personal achievements but also as a club. We have won several Battles this season, including, the Eurotunnel Trophy against Deal, Gateway (Dover), and Canterbury, (where we tied with Gateway (Dover)), and at the Battle at Malling we tied 2nd with 10 clubs entering.

If you have ever come along to our club and, perhaps been disappointed with that particular evenings presentation, do please come along and try us again. We now have approximately 70 members and our club is very strong, as you can see from above. Unfortunately some potential new members come along and that actual evening may not be their cup-of-tea so they dont come again, which is a shame as we have so much to offer anyone who is interested in photography. Our programme covers many aspects of photography and we try to suit everyones taste and ability Our motto is We dont Teach, But You Learn. Our new season will commence on 3rd September, and the Programme will be on our website for viewing from August.

Our meetings are held at the St Georges Church, Audley Road, (on the corner of Shorncliffe Road opposite West Station) Folkestone on Mondays at 7.45pm. New members are always welcome, if interested please phone Mrs Jenny Barraclough (Press Officer) 01303 245399. E mail: jenny-bar@btconnect.com</blockquote>
