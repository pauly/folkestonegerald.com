Not heard the term <a href="/wiki/vanpacking">vanpacking</a> before <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-38061424">but I have now</a>. This is what we see in <a href="/wiki/seabrook">Seabrook</a> and <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a>. It's not quite the <a href="/wiki/gold+coast">gold coast</a> but it's great for the people in vans who can park up for free right on the coast, wake up with a lovely sea view but without the mortgage. I love to see it, each time I walk past one I wonder, could we ever do something like that? It's not a problem, but I guess it might be if there were hundreds all fighting for the limited facilities.

I bet THE MAN clamps down on this if they build all those new houses along <a href="/wiki/princes+parade">Princes Parade</a>.
