I've fixed the site again now so that your twitter feed will appear on your venue page, <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/totally-jazz/restaurant-food-bar-venue-12935/index.html">like it does here</a> for <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/totally-jazz/restaurant-food-bar-venue-12935/index.html">Totally Jazz</a>...

UPDATE: Yeah just like <a href="/wiki/totally+jazz">totally jazz</a>, the <a href="/wiki/twitter">twitter</a> feeds are gone. The Twitter changed the rules that made it difficult to do, so I canned it.
