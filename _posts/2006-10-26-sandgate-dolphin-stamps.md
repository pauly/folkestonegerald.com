You can <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/content2?catId=3800007&mediaId=3800008">make your own stamps here</a>, I think it's actually little stamp shaped stickers that go alongside a real stamp, rather than an actual stamp with your image on it, but I'm not sure.

Get some that have been already made at <a href="http://stores.ebay.co.uk/sandgatedolphin2006">this sandgate dolphin store</a>...
