A blogger (that I found, not me, nor connected with this site) says:

<blockquote>Oh, and did I tell you about the new ice rink in Folkestone?  I was mega excited about it.  So I went to check it out.

It sucks.

It's roughly the size of my kitchen.  Which is small.  Very small.  And it's out in the middle of no-where and right in the center of a building site.  So yeah.</blockquote>
