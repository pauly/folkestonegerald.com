<blockquote>We're putting together a street marketing team for Sellindge Music Festival (5, 6, 7 June 2009 - www.sellindgemusicfestival.com), and wondered if you know any enthusiastic music fans that would like to be part of the team! 

We need marketers to get posters in shops, put flyers on counters, mini-flyers on cars, and hand out flyers in the street/campuses on various days throughout the next few months. All members of the street team will get a free weekend ticket to the festival including the HeadRoc dance arena. I'm coordinating a meeting for the street marketers this Thursday the 12th - before the Main Stage Talent Tournament gig at The Frenchman in Folkestone at 6pm (which everyone is welcome to stay for after!) - so if anyone is interested, please have them email me directly at donna@pomelomarketing.com to let me know they're coming or with any questions!!</blockquote>
