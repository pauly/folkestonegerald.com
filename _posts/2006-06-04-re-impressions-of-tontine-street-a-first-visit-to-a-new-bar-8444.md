I visited this 'hidden jewel'. Why is it so quiet?  The food was excellent, service great and the staff welcoming and friendly. Maybe Folkestone or Tontine St is not ready for this yet.  Use it or lose it i say.  What an excellent venue for the World Cup! As you say a good place for a drink or eat before club land.  I will be back for the footie.  I hope i am not crying alone!  Give it a try.
