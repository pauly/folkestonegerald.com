Sure it wasn't <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/1970/">1970</a> though? <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/blues/remedy/concertfiles.html">this site says so</a>, and the 15th was a Friday in <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/1969">1969</a>. Do you have any more info? Were you there?

Thanks for contributing.
