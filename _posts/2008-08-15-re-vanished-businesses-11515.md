Feltonfleet moved to Cobham, Surrey after moving from Folkestone and pupils were evacuated during the war to Perrott Hill in Crewkerne, Somerset.  After the war, the school moved back to the existing site in Surrey and is very much thriving now as a co-educational prep school for pupils between the ages of 3 and 13.  The School has an active Former Pupils Association and if you would like further details, do please email the school office@feltonfleet.co.uk and they can forward your details to Peter Colbourne-Baber who heads the FPA and as a former pupil himself has also done a great deal of research into the history of the school, which recently celebrated its centenary.  The school website <a href="http://www.feltonfleet.co.uk">feltonfleet.co.uk</a> provides lots of information about the school and we welcome visits from former pupils.
