Aargh, another nail in my <a href="/wiki/not+drinking">not drinking</a> coffin, of course the <a href="/wiki/beer+festival">beer festival</a> is on this weekend. It's three days from the 11th - 13th September and tasting notes are now up on <a href="http://folkestonebeerfestival.co.uk">the website</a>.
