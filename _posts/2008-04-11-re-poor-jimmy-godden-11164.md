I am so pleased that someone is concerned about Mr Godden's spate of bad luck, I am sure that Jimmy will appreciate this community spirit - after all Mr Godden has always had the towns' best interests at heart. It is good to know that there is one developer  who does not behave in a shabhy, corrupting, self-interested manner. There has been so much of that in the past, especially in Folkestone, where corrupt local politicians and greedy developers have scarred our landscape with money-making monstosities ie., Queens house replaced the Beautiful Queen's Hotel, The lovely Royal Pavillion Hotel, knocked down to erect The ugly Burstin. These beautiful Victorian buildings were a heritage of the town - our heritage! - now they have been wiped off the landscape forever.
Our latest 'White elephant' - The Bouverie Road Shopping centre, will, in time, become another eyesore, as it fails, to make the profit envisaged by its schemers.  

Two things we must concern ourselves with in the future - stop all demolition of lovely buildings in the town - and make sure that Richard de Haan comliments the town with his seafront scheme - what is built now, will be the attractions of the future, or, another nail in the coffin of the prosperity of Folkestone.
