The wife and I were made to sit apart again in the Famous Ship Quiz, no-one else gets this treatment, wonder what's going on? We don't win every week, but ironically Clare has won each time we've been made to play apart...

"FUN" quiz, every Tuesday at the Famous Ship Inn. No current affairs, brush up on your military history, geography, and religion. A bottle of wine for the winner.
