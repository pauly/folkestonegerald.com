<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1705927,00.html">The feature I've been waiting for for ages</a>, it's a bit light though. They do say property in the town is "fantastic", and mention the regeneration, though they recognise it's a way of still. They messed up a bit called <a href="/wiki/cheriton">Cheriton</a> "villagey" though I feel... "the restaurant at the hotel" get a special mention too, that's <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a>, but would that be the up-for-grabs <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/1923/Sandgate%20Hotel">Sandgate Hotel</a>?
