The Folkestone People's History Centre, run by Canterbury Christ Church University, is giving Folkestone schools and local people the opportunity to learn more about the early history of Folkestone.

A three-day history weekend workshop, called "Dig for History!", has been organised by the University in conjunction with Kent Libraries and Archives, and will take place from Thursday 12th October to Saturday 14th October.

The event will see key stage two pupils from Cheriton, Morehall, St Eanswythe's,
St Martin's and St Mary's Primary Schools, all from Folkestone, take part in a range of activities including an archaeological reconstruction and the chance to handle Roman artefacts.  This will take place between 10am and 4pm on Thursday 12th October and Friday 13th October.

"Dig for History!" will also include a series of evening events for local people.  On Thursday 12th October, there will be an opportunity to hear about the most up-to-date account of Anglo Saxon and Norman Folkestone. Canterbury Christ Church University's Pro-Vice Chancellor (Dean of Arts and Humanities), Dr Paul Dalton, will give a talk on: "Folkestone and its Lords in the First Century of Norman Rule."  This will be followed by Kent County Council's Finds Liaison Officer, Dr Andrew Richardson, who will give a presentation on: "Anglo Saxon Kent and Folkestone".

On Friday 13th October, Canterbury Christ Church University's Phd student, Carol Moran, will give a talk on: "Homer and History: Archaeology and Greek Myth".

Both events will take place at 7pm at Folkestone Library.  Tickets for these events are 2 and are available at Folkestone Library, and include wine and light refreshments.

The climax of the history event will be a free joint "Family Archaeology Day" and "Finds Day" on Saturday 14th October at Folkestone Library.  Visitors will get the opportunity to handle artefacts and learn about medieval Folkestone through a wide range of displays and models.  Local people will also get the chance to have their 'finds' identified and talk to archaeologists from Canterbury Archaeological Trust and Kent County Council.

A Roman Folkestone Exhibition will also be on show at The Folkestone People's History Centre, 67, The Old High Street, Folkestone, throughout October.

Head of the Folkestone People's History Centre, Dr Lesley Hardy, said: "This workshop provides an exciting opportunity to meet with professional archaeologists and historians.  We are delighted to be working with local people to discover together the early history of the town."
