Tim Fitzhigham's crossing of the Channel in a bathtub (to Folkestone, of course) is features on <a href="http://www.paramountcomedy.com/livecomedy/news/news_article/repa/id~135">Paramount Comedy here</a>, but double Olympic champion <a href="/wiki/james+cracknell">James Cracknell</a> is aiming  to be the fastest man to paddle across the Channel, on a surfboard.

He's going to raise 60k for charity when he leaves the beach at Folkestone on the 5th of September. [[<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/rowing/4738677.stm">More from the BBC</a>.
