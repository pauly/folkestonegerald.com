Not along The Leas I hope, where skating is OUTLAWED:

<blockquote>British Longboard Team Prepare for the Challenge of a Life Time

The stage is set for a team of longboard skateboarders from Devon, UK to attempt a World Record Breaking marathon. In July 2007, the BeatsWalkinEurope team will begin an epic 4000km skate marathon from North Devon in England through France, Switzerland and Spain. Their aim is to raise funds and awareness for 3 childrens charities - Link Community Development, the Lowe Syndrome Trust and Sailability Australia.

Barnstaple, UK (PRWEB) January 1, 2007 -- In July 2007, Longboard Skateboarders Sam Benson and Jay Duggan will set off on a 3000km Skateboarding Journey, following in the footsteps of BoardFree's Dave Cornthwaite.

Sam and jay have been skateboarding for 3 years, and only saw it as a hobby until they heard about Dave Cornthwaite's Marathon journeys for charity. Jay came up with the idea of trying to help Dave in any way they could. With BoardFree's support, BeatsWalkinEurope was born.

BeatsWalkin, named after Sam and Jay's local skate shop Beats Workin, will see the longboard enthusiast's skateboard through 6 of the most famous cities in Europe. The journey they have planned currently takes them from North Devon, across the South Coast of England to Folkestone in Kent. From there they will board the EuroStar and cross the British Channel into Calais in France.

From Calais they will head through Lille and on into Paris before heading south into Marseille and across the Pyrenees into Spain. The trip then takes them through Barcelona and Valencia on the Mediterranean coast before they head north through Madrid on into Santander.

All that lies ahead of them then is an overnight ferry crossing and a relatively short skate from Plymouth to Barnstaple in North Devon. In total, the trip is planned to take between 8 and 10 weeks to complete, averaging 30-35km per day.

BeatsWalkin is part of the BoardFree initiative, which Dave Cornthwaite founded in 2005. BoardFree and BeatsWalkin aim to raise funds and awareness for three children's charities; Sailability Australia, Link Community Development and the Lowe Syndrome Trust, as well as promoting sport to youngsters of all ages and abilities by encouraging a 'no-limits' approach to life.
