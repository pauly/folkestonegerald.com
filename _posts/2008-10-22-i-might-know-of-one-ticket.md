I think I know someone who might not be able to go, stay tuned, or email me - fg@folkestonegerald.com - or maybe some other kind soul will read this and reply?

[abe]Sandi Toksvig[/abe] is also doing a date at the <a href="/wiki/gulbenkian+gulbenkian+theatre+in+canterbury">Gulbenkian | Gulbenkian Theatre in Canterbury</a>, have you tried there? I went there on Tuesday, it's very nice.

As an outside chance I suppose [ebay=sandi+toksvig+tickets]it's worth trying ebay[/ebay]... She's not exactly [ebay=ac/dc tickets]AC/DC[/ebay] though.
