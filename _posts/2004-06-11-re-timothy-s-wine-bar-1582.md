Gary - the review was not unfair.  You were not at our table and didn't receive the service we did.  I'm pretty sure you also didn't call into Timothy's the week before the Spanish night and pay an 80 deposit to ensure that our vegan chum would have something decent to eat.  I'm also pretty sure that you didn't have to endure the husband of the "chef" berating you for having the temerity to remark that the food wasn't that nice.  And please bear in mind, we didn't go out of our way to complain.  We were simply honest when we were asked "how was your meal".

As for your comment about a more "decent approach to the reviews", what would you prefer ?  A review that simply says what was on the menu with no comment about quality ?  If you recall I did actually say at the end of my review that people should make their own minds up.  This is a website where I and my friends and family can post our own views on meals we have had in Folkestone.  You don't have to read it.  But personally I am delighted that its starting to cause some aggro and discussion.  Maybe that is exactly what is needed in Folkestone to raise the quality of the eating-out experience here and stop complacent restaurant owners fobbing off poor quality food at exorbitant prices.  If you want to know how it should be done, read my reviews of <a href="/wiki/kapetan+michales">Kapetan Michales</a> and <a href="/wiki/pauls">Pauls</a>.

Finally, I'll ignore your silly little remarks about spelling.  Nice to hear from you though.
