Thanks to Simon Brint for this ticket scan...
<a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/6534/Cream+1967">People say</a> it wasn't <a href="/wiki/tofts">Tofts</a>, it was <a href="/wiki/mick+s+flamenco+club">Mick's Flamenco Club</a> (more recently <a href="/wiki/pipers">Pipers</a>), so did Toft's move more than once? Or did Tofts move the gig? Or did they promote the gig at another club? Anyone got details?
