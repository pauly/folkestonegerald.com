A mile or two back from the coast at Dymchurch in West Hythe, this is a great little find.

Ideal for cyclists touring the Marsh, (cycle rack are provided next to a lovely little beer garden overlooking fields full of sheep.) or for those seeking something different from the tat of the pubs in nearby Dymchurch.

Food is the reason to come here. Locally caught fish, fantastic lamb, piping hot seasonal vegetables.... a great extensive menu. This is not mass-produced rubbish, so don't expect to be served within minutes. In six months of return visits, we have never been disappointed with the fare.

And a friendly personable welcome from the owners and staff.

A great find in the area.
