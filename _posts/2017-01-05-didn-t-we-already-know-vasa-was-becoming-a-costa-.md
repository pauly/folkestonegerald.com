<a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/coffee-chain-on-way-with-118374/">Now it has been confirmed</a>... I was hoping it was actually the group that owns <a href="/wiki/costa">Costa</a> that had bought it and it would become a pub, but no. Does seem odd, it's not even right in <a href="/wiki/sandgate">Sandgate</a> will they get enough footfall? Guess they know something we don't and it will be worthwhile for them. Can't see us ever going in it though.
