Hello, I went onto this site because I was looking for an unbiased opinion about the Drum Inn. I was pleased to read your comments because I was about to book it for lunch today, but as you can imagine I have now changed my mind, why do so many pubs spoil themselves by trying to be something they are not. I have been in catering for 20 years and am constantly disappointed with so-called gastro pubs priding themselves on exquisite quisine when I'm sure the closest the Chefs has got to Chateau Briand is throwing a burger over in McDonalds. I'm not saying this is the case at the Drum as I have never dined there but powdered soup is a bit of a giveaway. I'd love to be proved wrong by this pub as it's in such a great location and as I have only just moved to the area was hoping to use it as my local, so if the Landlord wants a challenge close the restaurant and stage a grand re-opening and maybe the comments might just improve, thanks for reading, Julie.
