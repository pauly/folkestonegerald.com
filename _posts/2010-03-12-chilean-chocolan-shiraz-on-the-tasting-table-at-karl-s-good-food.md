<blockquote>2005 Syrah, Chocolan, Chile: On the whole, Chile has always made solid, well-made wines that are flawless but very often unremarkable.However, in recent years, an appreciation for matching grapes to particular sites, altitudes and soils has been on the increase and the resulting wines are getting interesting. This is a great example of what we can expect out of Chile in the coming years - fantastic new world Syrah with a masterful use of oak giving the rich clean Syrah fruit a spicy and smoky edge. Forward-thinking wine making at its best - 9.95 </blockquote>
