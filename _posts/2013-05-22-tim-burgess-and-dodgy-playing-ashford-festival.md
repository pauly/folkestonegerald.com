<a href="http://www.createfestival.co.uk/">Create Festival</a>, it's a one day event headlined by <a href="/wiki/dodgy">Dodgy</a> on 28th July but <a href="/wiki/tim+burgess">Tim Burgess</a> is playing a related event on the 26th. Has he just moved to <a href="/wiki/ashford">Ashford</a> or something? I think he just played <a href="/wiki/revelation+st+mary">Revelation St Mary</a>, also in Ashford. Or maybe this is that gig.
