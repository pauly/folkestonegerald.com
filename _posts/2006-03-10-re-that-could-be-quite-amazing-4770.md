Things are moving faster and faster. The new shopping centre will be open early next year, and the word from the wise is that the train link will actually be EARLIER than planned (!)

I spoke to Mike MacDonald of the council the other day, and he seemed to think that it would be running by 2008. Folkestone West and Central will both be served. That should SERIOUSLY bump up property prices.
