There's a lot of confusion surrounding <a href="/wiki/tofts">Tofts</a>, I think I have it covered though - after the original <a href="/wiki/tofts">Tofts</a> was demolished in the early 60's, "The Tofts", ie Mr and Mrs Toft who ran it moved to new premises... and people still called the new venue (<a href="/wiki/hillside+social+club">Hillside Social Club</a> on <a href="/wiki/grace+hill">Grace Hill</a> I think) "<a href="/wiki/tofts">Tofts</a>" too...

Thanks for your input anyway... when was the <a href="/wiki/dead+or+alive">Dead or Alive</a> gig?
