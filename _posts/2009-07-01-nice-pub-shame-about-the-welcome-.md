It saddens me to think in these days of hard times for pubs that certain pubs dont make an effort to be more user friendly. It is the second time I have been to this pub and have walked through the door be not greeted with a hello or welcome, but rather we close at 10 oclock on a Tuesday due to lack of business! May I suggest that its due to your attitude and I know that myself and my five friends will not be coming back to this pub so Tuesdays will be quieter than ever now! They say the County Members is a nice pub so best we use that in future....
