Hi, Sky News will be in Folkestone on Tuesday afternoon as part of our election coverage, and we're trying to pull together a group of local voters to give us their views on the election - what the big issues are for YOU, and what you make of the three parties. I know Pauly can't vote, but that doesnt matter, everyone's opinions still count. So if you live in Folkestone, and want to be on TV, or want to get your message across to the politicians - please email me at robert.owers@bskyb.com, or phone me on 07751200227, and I'll explain all. Thanks!
