There's always <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/12004178959F620B">Elton John at the O2</a> if you haven't... 

I see <a href="/wiki/gate+28">Gate 28</a> are doing tickets, a fiver only though. What is going on elsewhere?

Also, really does no-one have an opinion on <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/m/11768/What+bands+would+you+like+to+see+play+Folkestone+">who they'd like to play Folkestone</a>?
