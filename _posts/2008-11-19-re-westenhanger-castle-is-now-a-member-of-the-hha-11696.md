Westenhanger Castle is open to all members of the public on Tuesdays between April and September. These 'days' are run by volunteers of the castle, therefore it is not possible to open at other times of the week or year. 

Updated opening times and entry prices can be found on <a href="http://www.westenhangercastle.co.uk">westenhangercastle.co.uk</a>
