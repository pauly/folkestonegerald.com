Hi There!
Tim Bryan (me) ex-folkestonian...
I heard that there is a memorial site in tontine street that used to be a pub, got bombed in wwII??
Apparently there's a plaque on this site.
Is it the little triangle at the end where the road splits?? (heading uphill from the amusements, etc.)
I would love to know the answer to that if you can tell me more,
Thanks
