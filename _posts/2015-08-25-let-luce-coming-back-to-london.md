OK not a big deal in the grand scheme of things as they were in London before I saw them at <a href="/wiki/edinburgh+fringe">Edinburgh Fringe</a>. But, <a href="http://laughoutlondoncomedyclub.co.uk/2015/08/15/alternative-pick-of-the-fringe-in-camden-september-4/">they're coming back</a>. This amazes me, four quid for four shows, of which they are one. I hope it is as good as I remember as I'm planning to leave work early and rearrange my weekend around it. I'm quite nervous about this. Who's with me?
