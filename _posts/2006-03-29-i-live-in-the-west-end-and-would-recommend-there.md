I would say somewhere between the station and the town would be a good bet, have a look at <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/map/property.html the property map]]" title="feasible commuter town">to see what streets that is.

There's a high speed rail link coming in the next few years that will make Folkestone a [[commute</a> for London, and you're by the sea too!

Most of the investment is going to be on the coast, a new <a href="/wiki/marina">marina</a> is being built down by the <a href="/wiki/harbour">harbour</a>.

Have a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=folkestone%20creative%20foundation"> google for the Creative Foundation's works</a> too and post back with what you find.
