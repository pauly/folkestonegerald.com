Is it in a real leather sleeve?

I only saw them at <a href="/wiki/portsmouth+guildhall">Portsmouth Guildhall</a>, in 1989 I think, good to tick them off the list, but I wouldn't rush to see them again I don't think. You seeing them again, they're back at the <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/v/2/Leas%20Cliff%20Hall">LCH</a> soon innit?

Coincidence that <a href="/wiki/hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> seem to have played the week before.
