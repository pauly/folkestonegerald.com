Dude i was at that Manics gig man it kicked ass. They cancelled the first week because James Dean Bradfeild had a bad throat so they couldnt play. but it was worth the wait, me and a load of guys came up from Rye to see that show. i  remember i had all my fucking hair back combed and had spent the whole day polishing my cow boy boots, lol! just saw that the Metromome is no more, was just looking around for other venues to play with my band "TORQUE ARMADA", and thought of the METRONOME and how i would love to play there. is there anything else down that neck of the woods now? if ya know of any our email is torquearmada@hotmail.co.uk    -oh and check us out at www.myspace.com/torquearmada
