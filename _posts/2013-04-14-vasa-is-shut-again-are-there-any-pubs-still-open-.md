Only just spotted that <a href="/wiki/bar+vasa">Bar Vasa</a> is shut again, and up for sale freehold. Also while driving back from Dover yesterday saw that <a href="/wiki/black+bull">The Black Bull</a> is gone (boarded up) and so is <a href="/wiki/castle">The Castle</a> near Radnor Park. There really aren't that many pubs left are there?

<a href="/wiki/fountain">The Fountain</a> is still shut after the flooding, I would not be surprised if it did not reopen.

Had a walk around Folkestone Harbour today, was a nice afternoon.
