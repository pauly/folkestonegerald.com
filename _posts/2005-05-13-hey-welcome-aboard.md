How do the times compare then? Going into Victoria sounds like it ought to be faster somehow. I'm finding going in via London Bridge and home again via Cannon Street to be quite convenient, but the actual journey is slower... I'm praying for the days when the train flies from Ashford to Kings Cross with no stops...
