<a href="/wiki/ron+vaudry">RON VAUDRY</a> (Intelligent, witty and sardonic, Ron Vaudry is the thinking man's comedian. A satirical genius teetering precariously at the edge of comedy, Vaudry guides audiences through a series of hilarious, yet thought provoking political and social observations.  He has several television appearances in the States, including some of the most popular 'Late Shows' on network TV there.  "As hard-boiled and urban as any native New Yorker." -  The Scotsman)
 
<a href="/wiki/lee+bannard">LEE BANNARD</a> (Having been on the circuit for just two years, Lee Bannard is already making a name for himself as one of the country's best deadpan acts.  Taking droll inspiration from the likes of <a href="/wiki/jack+dee">Jack Dee</a>, <a href="/wiki/mackenzie+crook">Mackenzie Crook</a> and American comic <a href="/wiki/stephen+wright">Stephen Wright</a>, Lee's collection of observations and experiences are all presented in his own initimable and slightly threatening manner.  After a few short months on the circuit, Lee was a finalist in the 2004 Channel 4 So You Think You're Funny competition and was this year hand-selected to be part of The Comedy Reserve package show in Edinburgh. a treasure trove of inventive, funny lines that suit his distinctive persona...this is a lad who very clearly knows what he's doing.  Expect to see him go far" - CHORTLE)
 
<a href="/wiki/del+strain">DEL STRAIN</a> (in our open spot, from Glasgow, Del Strain is infamous for his slightly psychotic, and often unintelligible Internet rants.  I've never seen him before, but have heard he's good and, to be honest, I'm intrigued)
 
guest compere <a href="/wiki/rob+heeney">ROB HEENEY</a> (Danny is bunking off for yet another month, so we welcome Rob Heeney to the club.  He's one of my favourite circuit comperes, instantly amiable with a slightly inventive wit.)
