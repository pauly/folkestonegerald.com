A <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=405785&in_page_id=1770">cheery tale of an asylum seeking drug addict thief</a> from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk">the daily hate</a>:

<blockquote>A Judge yesterday described the Home Office as 'totally incompetent' after blunders left him unable to sentence a Russian serial shoplifter who was twice recommended for deportation.

Refugee Mohammed Gaparkhoev has been facing punishment for nearly a year for breaching an Anti Social Behaviour Order banning him from shops [in Folkestone]. </blockquote>

I'm sure I saw this guy in the town centre this morning...
