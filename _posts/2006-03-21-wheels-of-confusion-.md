<a href="http://www.black-sabbath.com/tourdates/1970.html">black-sabbath.com</a> and <a href="http://www.ozzyhead.com/olddates/olddates.htm">ozzyhead.com</a> both say the gig was at Tofts, but they could both be copied from the same innacurate source, I will do more searching for the <a href="/wiki/school+of+art">School of Art</a> if you think the gig might have been there...
