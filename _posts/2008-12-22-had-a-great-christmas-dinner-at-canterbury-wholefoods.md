Booked into Canterbury Wholefoods for lunch on Saturday and very glad we did, had a brilliant christmas dinner, nut roast, roast veges, potatoes, gravy, christmas pud and ice cream, all vegan, brilliant. I would phone up and book if you're heading there on a Saturday, but in theory you can just walk in.

Really good, look forward to going more when we live closer.
