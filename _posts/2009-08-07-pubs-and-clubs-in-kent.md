Dear someone,

I think the Leas Club and Weatherspoons are similar to the old fashioned proper pubs and then the only pub that I have not been to for years is Jolstons but I don't even know if that place is still open and if it is, I think it is now called something else, can anyone tell me a bit more about what it is like in there nowadays? From Emma, 33 in Folkestone.
