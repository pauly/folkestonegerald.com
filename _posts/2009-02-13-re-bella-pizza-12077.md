"My wife and I did not spend more than 5 minutes in the restaurant before we walked out."

and yet you were able to determine in that time that the "Service was unprofessional, rude, arrogant and unapologetic."

What service could you have possibly had in the less than 5 minutes you were there?
What could the staff have done in that short space of time that was so appalling that you should have been afforded an apology?

To me you sound like an arrogant and pompous idiot who would be better served by visiting McDonalds or Burger King so those of us who appreciate good food and good service (as I have always had at Bella Pizza & Pasta) do not have to put up with your whining - which no doubt would have been the case had you even given the staff the chance to seat you.

I bet if you have to wait at a supermarket checkout for more than 30 seconds you dump your trolley and storm off in a huff moaning about your disgraceful service - oh no, don't tell me, you wouldn't visit one of <i>those</i> places.

Incredible.
