I need to remind myself that i am lucky that Ronald Reeeeeeeeeeegan (thanks JP) is dead and that we still have our health, not to mention our nuclear weapons.  And that the pixies last friday were worth living for.

I realise, of course, that this has nothin to do with my remit as "gastronaut extrodinaire", but fuck it.

It was also humiliating and moving to see our last, great compassionate leader MT cry at her own previously recorded speech.  

Anyone remember the poll tax riots (where even my parents were scared), star wars and the original special relationship ?

Sorry - a bit of vitriol is good.

Gonna get drunk now.
