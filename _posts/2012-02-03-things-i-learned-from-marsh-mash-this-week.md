Picked up the local <a href="/wiki/camra">CAMRA</a> 'zine in <a href="/wiki/britannia">The Britannia</a> on Wednesday. As well as reminding me (too late) that it's <a href="/wiki/dover+winter+ales+festival">Dover Winter Ales festival</a> at <a href="/wiki/dover+town+hall">Dover Town Hall</a> this weekend (was great when I have been previously, though no fun queueing to get in in this weather), I learned more... <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=unfined+beer">Unfined Beer</a> sounds like a great concept, I could enjoy beer with a clear vegan conscience - cloudy cider is great, so why not traditional cloudy ale? See <a href="http://www.moorbeer.co.uk">moorbeer.co.uk</a> for more details.

Also the new owners of <a href="/wiki/vasa">Vasa</a> are Henry and Jude from the <a href="/wiki/three+mariners">Three Mariners</a> and they are considering offering a real ale in there, lawks! That would be great. Can't see them getting enough customers in there to get through a barrel of ale in time, even if every single one of them ordered it right now. Went in over christmas and it was very quiet. Still best of luck to you. If you get one in let me know and I will pop down
