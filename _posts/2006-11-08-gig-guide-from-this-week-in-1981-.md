so it wasn't all big name indie bands playing the [fg]Metronome[/fg] every night as I've been led to believe... here's a fascinating republication of gig listings from [year]1981[/year], from the good people at <a href="http://www.kentgigs.com">kentgigs.com</a>. Don't forget my <a href="http://www.folkestonegerald.com/gigs/">Folkestone gig guide</a> though.

<blockquote>We showed in our mailout on Tuesday that we have been supplying the press and music fans with listings for 25 years. It has raised a little interest so we have produced below the gig guide for this week, 25 years ago. Might bring back some memories for some and a chance to air some idle thoughts whilst typing.
 
Our first Gig Guide actually hit the press on 25th April [year]1981[/year] in one Folkestone newspaper along with a write up for a band and a photo which was the deal we obtained. This newspaper was the only one who had a gig guide with more than just a couple of lines of information. If hadn't been for the national music press of the time i.e. <a href="/wiki/nme">NME</a>, <a href="/wiki/sounds">Sounds</a> and <a href="/wiki/melody+maker">Melody Maker</a> we could have been the inventors of the Gig Guide. We also flyposted throughout the local area in the once many music shops, corner shops and record stores.
 
There were no computers, email or internet, affordable photocopying or home printers, just handwriting and relying on the local friendly printer who created our masterpieces by a screenprinting process. The newspapers were created by hand-set lead type in wooden blocks. When you went to the local press it was like a factory with clattering typewriters, smoke from the molten lead and guys with dirty hands.</blockquote>
