Hi Gerald, do you have any details of the Summer Season show at the Leas Cliff in [year]1974[/year] with <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=gordon+bunny+jay">Gordon & Bunny Jay</a>?

I spent a fab season with them staying in Sandgate and wanted reminding of the variety show acts.

Thanks

Phil
