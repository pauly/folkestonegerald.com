  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>This site used to ask you to log in, and set cookies on your local machine so as to identify you when you return, but it doesn't do that now.</p>
  <p>I may still use third party advertising like Google adsense and they may set cookies, look out for that.</p>
  <p>As a result of me removing logins and identifying info, you can't leave messages here any more.
  Boo hoo.
  I may bring this back if I can find a way.
  Email me instead.</p>
