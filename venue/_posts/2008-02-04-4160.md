<blockquote> To be precise, as the inscription carved in 1632 on the impressive English oak sideboard proclaims "A Ryghte Joyouse and welcome greetynge to ye all".
"Truly Traditional" really is the welcome that awaits you as you step back in time to this unspoilt, medieval lamplit tavern. Ringlestone hamlet is nestled off the beaten track in the North Downs, yet only 5 minutes drive from Leeds castle and junction 8 of the M20 motorway.</blockquote>
