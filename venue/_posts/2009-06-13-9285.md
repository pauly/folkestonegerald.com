<blockquote>Friendly country pub on outskirts of town but still in a village location with a slant on fresh cooked good value meals which are Mexican and English in style.

Where ever possible we use locally sourced meat and vegetables.

We also have 5 real ales on draught for the beer lover and a good selection of wines to complement our food.

If you like cosy candlelit dining of an evening with prices that don't break your bank then this is the place to come.

Please don't expect carpets or all the glitz of a theme pub as what you see is what you get here and is a must for people who hate blarring music, enjoy being able to talk to their friends and just enjoy a good atmosphere.</blockquote>
