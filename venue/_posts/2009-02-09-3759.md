Fantastic cellar bar / restaurant / guest house, well kept real ales and fantastic service, we're booked in for dinner next week and will report back...

<blockquote>Blakes of Dover is quite unique as an excellent real ale house with at least 3 ales from micro breweries always on tap from our new stillage, a fine restaurant specialising in freshly prepared modern and traditional British cuisine, complete with superior 4 diamond ensuite accommodation.

The connections to Europe are less than 5 minutes away with a choice of fast catamaran ferries to Boulogne or conventional car ferries to Calais and Dunkerque. Dover's busy cruise terminal is also close by. The A20 and A2 trunk routes are both within a mile, while the railway station and bus/coach station are 10 and 5 minutes' walk respectively.

Blake's of Dover bed and breakfast offers beautifully decorated en-suite rooms: sleeping 2, 3 or 4 guests. All rooms have colour television and complementary tea, coffee and biscuits etc., radio alarm clock, trouser press and hairdryer.

Our spacious superior rooms have a king size bed and also one or two additional single beds, so when made up they can comfortably accommodate a family of three or four.</blockquote>
