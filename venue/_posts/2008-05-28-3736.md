Wedding venue.
<blockquote>A unique and intimate setting

Our 200-year-old Kentish barn stands in a peaceful rural location surrounded by pastureland. The beautiful garden gazebo is perfect for spring and summer weddings, while the magnificent hallway and minstrels' gallery is licensed for wedding ceremonies all year round.

Whichever you choose, a splendid marquee on our southern lawn provides a stunning venue for your evening reception.

Inside and out, every detail has been meticulously designed to make The Old Kent Barn one of the most romantic settings to get married. Flowers, drapes and sumptuous furnishings  complement the Barn's magnificent hallway, while rose-scented gardens, statuettes, love seats and a cascading waterfall grace the landscaped grounds.</blockquote>
