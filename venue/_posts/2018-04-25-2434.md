AKA Shuttleworths, low key celeb hangout and members bar. Ideal for a cheeky one before a gig at the <a href="/wiki/london+astoria">London Astoria</a>. I don't recommend the food, and they don't do real ale, though I have seen some good beers in bottles.
It's a private members type place after a certain time in the evening.
