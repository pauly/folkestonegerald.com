<blockquote>Imli serve "tapas style" indian cuisine... they kept coming and piling more and more food on the table in front of us. The tasting menu is excellent and varied, lots of it is veggie too. It came to around 25 a head including a few bottles of wine... great value for excellent food, great service</blockquote>
